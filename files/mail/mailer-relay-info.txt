;  This file defines the sites which can be accessed via a mail
; relay.  These are not really "domains" in the Internet sense
; of the word but rather "pseudo-domains"; in other words, a
; mail registry typically established by transport rather than
; organizational considerations.
;
;  This file contains text lines of the format:
;RELAY <rulename>,<c><host>,<relays>
;	or
;HOST <rulename>,<primary>,<nicknames>
; where:
;
; <rulename>	::= any arbitrary name for this relay rule.  The
;		    name "Internet" is reserved for a relay going
;		    to the DoD Internet.  This name is removed in
;		    the process of transmogrification
; <c>		::= character to use in transmogrification
; <host>	::= host to use in transmogrification.  This
;		    is text.  It must have any domain names
;		    etc. that you want
; <relays>	::= list of relay hosts
; <primary>	::= primary host name, without rulename
; <nicknames>	::= list of nicknames
;
;  RELAY defines a relay rule, while HOST defines a host in a
; particular rule.  Transmogrification refers to the necessary
; steps to coerce the given host name into a valid Internet name
; in the actual message header.
