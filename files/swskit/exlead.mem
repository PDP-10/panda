SUBJ:  Extended leaders in TOPS20AN

        In releases prior to Release 4, TOPS20AN used  the  old
format IMP/Host protocol (BBN Report No.  1822).  This protocol
allows 6 bits to specify the destination IMP,  and  2  bits  to
specify  the  host  on the particular IMP.  This allows only 63
IMPs on the ARPANET (IMP  0  does  not  exist).   The  IMP/Host
protocol was extended some time ago to allow 16 bits to specify
the destination IMP, and 8 bits to  specify  the  host  on  the
particular  IMP.   Both  protocols  are currently in use on the
ARPANET, but since the 64th IMP has been added to the  network,
hosts  using  the  old protocol will not be able to communicate
with new hosts as they come on the network.  Also, at some time
in  the  future,  support for the old protocol will be dropped.
Because of this, support is being added to TOPS20AN for the new
protocol.   This memo documents the changes visible to the user
as a result of this work.
        Because there can now be an extremely large  number  of
hosts  on  the  network  ((2**16-1)*(2**8)),  it  is  no longer
possible to index GETAB tables by host  number.   To  ease  the
conversion,  all  old GETAB tables will be simulated in Release
4, but will only work for hosts with numbers which fit into the
old  protocol fields.  Hence, programs which use the old GETABs
will only know about hosts on IMPs numbered 1 through  63.   In
order to effectively communicate with all hosts on the network,
two new JSYSes have been added.

        This project will not  change  the  command-level  user
interface  of  TOPS20AN;   all  utilities will continue to work
just as well (or poorly) as they have in  the  past.   All  old
functionality  in the JSYS interface will continue.  Users will
be able to initiate, use,  and  terminate  network  connections
just  as  they have in the past, using the standard file-system
JSYSes.  In  order  to  address  new  network  hosts,  however,
programs will need to make use of the new JSYSes.



Applicable standards:


o       IMP/Host Protocol (BBN Report No.  1822)

o       Host/Host Protocol (NIC 7104)
