SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

     DDT is a symbolic assembly language debugger for the DECsystem-10
and  DECSYSTEM-20.   DDT provides many debugging facilities, including
breakpoints, program single-stepping, and the ability  to  examine  or
deposit  programs  or  data  symbolically.   The  source  file DDT.MAC
assembles into the following different versions of DDT:

TOPS-10         TOPS-20         FUNCTION

VMDDT.EXE       UDDT.EXE        Brought in by the DDT command.
DDT.EXE         SDDT.EXE        DDT with system symbols.
FILDDT.EXE      FILDDT.EXE      For EXE or binary data files.
DDT.REL         RDDT.REL        Relocatable user DDT.
EDDT.REL        EDDT.REL        Exec mode DDT.
  --            MDDT.REL        TOPS-20 monitor process DDT.
  --            KDDT.REL        TOPS-20 monitor specific EDDT.

     DDT version 41A is a maintenance release incorporating  30  edits
since  the  last  release.   Many  bug fixes have been made, and a few
enhancements have been included.  These are documented under  External
Changes, section 2.0, and Internal Changes, section 5.0.


                               WARNING

               A FEW OF THE NEW FEATURES IN DDT 41A ARE
               NOT COMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF
               DDT.  SOME  COMMANDS  THAT  WORKED  WITH
               PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF DDT MAY NOT WORK OR
               DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH DDT  41A.   SEE
               SECTION 2 FOR MORE INFORMATION.



     DDT 41A supersedes all previous  versions.   It  runs  under  all
supported  monitors, and has been tested under TOPS-10 7.01, and under
TOPS-20 releases 4 and 5.  All edits made through 30-Nov-81 have  been
incorporated into DDT 41A.

     For DECsystem-10  sites,  DDT  is  documented  in  the  Utilities
manual,  which  is  part  of  notebook  12  of  the  TOPS-10  Software
Notebooks.  The manual can also be ordered separately as order  number
DEC-10-UTILA-A-D.   Although  this  manual  documents version 37, most
commands are still supported as outlined in  the  manual.   FILDDT  is
also documented in notebook 12.

     For DECSYSTEM-20 sites, DDT is not documented.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     Most of the external changes in DDT 41A  are  new  features  that
make  the  debugging  process  easier.   Following  is  a  list of new
commands and features.


                         INCOMPATABLE CHANGES

               SOME OF THE CHANGES  TO  DDT  MAY  CAUSE
               COMMANDS   THAT  WORKED  UNDER  PREVIOUS
               VERSIONS  OF  DDT  TO  NOT  WORK  OR  DO
               DIFFERENT  THINGS  WITH  DDT  41A.   THE
               FOLLOWING  LIST   DESCRIBES   ALL   SUCH
               CHANGES.   PLEASE BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
               THIS LIST BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO  USE  DDT
               41A.



     1.  RP20 disks are now supported in FILDDT.

     2.  Users who build DDT-10 with FTYANK on may turn off $Y echo by
         typing  4$1M  (1B33);   this  sets  a  TTY  control bit which
         determines whether echoing occurs or not.  The default is  to
         echo the $Y input/output (0B33).

     3.  DDT types short error messages under certain conditions  now.
         Attempting  to  deposit  in a write-locked page will generate
         the message "?NOT WRITABLE".

     4.  The $?  and $$?  commands  have  been  implemented.   The  $?
         command  types  the last DDT error such as NOT WRITABLE, etc.
         The  $$?   command  types  the  last  TOPS-20  process  error
         encountered.

     5.  The $$Z command has been removed.  The new command format  is
         start-address<end-address>new-contents$Z.   If "new-contents"
         is not specified, the default is 0.

     6.  The $$1X command  has  been  implemented.   This  command  is
         similar  to  $$X,  except  that  no  "dangerous  instruction"
         checking is done.  Dangerous instructions are those which can
         alter  the  PSI/APR  status,  do I/O, or in any way alter the
         environment which DDT perceives.  This command is offered for
         convenience  only  since  it executes much faster, but is not
         recommended.  The normal $$X command should still be used.

     7.  TOPS-20 User-mode DDTs and FILDDT now have the command $2F to
         type   double   precision  floating  point  numbers.   Single
         precision numbers now use the FLOUT%  JSYS  rather  than  the
         cumbersome  "by-hand"  method  used  on  TOPS-10.   Thus  the
         typeout format is slightly different, and rounding may make a
         1 digit difference in the displayed value.
DDT41A.DOC -- Changes from DDT 41(265) to DDT 41A(323)          Page 4
EXTERNAL CHANGES


     8.  New GFLOATING opcodes are recognized by DDT.   These  include
         GFAD, GFSB, GFDV, and GFMP.

     9.  FILDDT now types out the $M and $U masks upon command.  These
         masks  cannot  be  changed  as  in  other  DDTs;  the command
         new-value$M or new-value$U must still be used.

    10.  The command $$0> has been added to abort a patch.  Starting a
         new patch while another is in progress is no longer possible,
         thus users are protected against  accidentally  destroying  a
         patch  by  typing  $<  instead  of  $> to finish.  It is also
         possible to type ^Z followed by DDT  to  reenter  with  patch
         mode reset.

    11.  The close-patch command format is now $n>, where "n"  is  the
         decimal number of returns desired.  The default is 2, but can
         be set from 0 to any value.  The  instructions  inserted  are
         JUMPAs, with the AC field starting at 0 and "pegging" at 17.

    12.  The $T command will now only type  a  single  right-justified
         character  if  the  entire  word  is  zero  (except  for  the
         character itself).  Previously, a single character  would  be
         typed  whenever  the  first  byte  was  a  null, rendering it
         impossible to type text if the first character in a word  was
         null.

    13.  The new $0T command  types  ASCIZ  strings  starting  at  any
         address  (default  is  ".").   Repeated  issuance of $0T will
         continue stepping through memory, typing consecutive strings.
         Typeout may be halted by typing any character.

    14.  FILDDT-20 no longer searches non-zero sections in data files.
         The search will stop after the last page in the file.

    15.  If a FILOP. error occurs when loading a file with  FILDDT-10,
         the  radix  is  set  back to octal by FILDDT's error handling
         routine.

    16.  Exec mode DDT now supports ^S/^Q and typeahead.

    17.  If the FTYANK feature is  enabled  (TOPS-10  only),  DDT  can
         automatically execute a command string each time a breakpoint
         is reached.  The  command  list  address  is  specified  when
         setting   the   breakpoint,   using   the  following  format:
         "addr-to-display<command-list-addr>breakpoint-addr$nB".   The
         command   string   can   be  defined  into  memory  with  the
         double-quote command, and must be left-justified ASCIZ.

KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     The  following  is  a  complete  list  of  all  known  bugs   and
deficiencies in DDT 41A as of 7-Jan-82.

     1.  DDT does not detect many illegal commands,  for  example,  18
         octal  is  accepted  and  treated  as 20 octal.  DDT does not
         detect arguments to commands which are ignored, e.g., $23Q is
         the same as $Q.

     2.  The commands $<CR>, and $<LF> do not detect  the  attempt  to
         recall more than was saved.

     3.  When looking at user rather than  exec  memory  in  FILDDT-10
         (e.g.  n$mU), the AC's still come from CRSHAC rather than the
         user pages.

     4.  Symbolic typeout is turned off for $O  mode,  thus  addresses
         are absolute rather than relative.

        default to 1 if user has specified own number.

314     JBS     10-AUG-81

        undefined symbols not getting fixed up.

315     JBS     13-AUG-81       SPR 10-31459
        Output radix wasn't setup before typing FILOP. error code, causing
        garbage to print out.  FILDDT-10 only.

316     JBS     17-AUG-81
        Find "real" EOF for a TOPS-20 file - edit 313 broke this because it
        assumed SIZEF% returned EOF.  But EOF doesn't really exist in TOPS-20!

317     JBS/RDH 19-AUG-81
        [JBS] Fix FILDDT-20 for big data file again.
        [RDH] Handle ^S/^Q in exec mode, implement exec mode typeahead,
        implement xxx<adr>n$B where "adr" is address of command string to
        be executed on breakpoint (depends on FTYANK), handle $X'ing in
        the ACs in non-zero section (PC always local, therefore always
        a "register" address).

320     RDH/JBS 30-SEP-81
        Edit 317 broke typing something to get out of a (e.g.) search
        loop (EXEC mode only), preserve APR bits in EXEC mode, type "/"
        instead of a space in $0T command.

321     JBS     30-SEP-81
        Remove definition of RADIX50 PAT from list of patch locations in
        user mode.

322     JBS     6-OCT-81
        Physically remove desupported $L code.

323     JBS     30-NOV-81
        Don't use JSYSes for numeric typeout in TOPS-20 EXEC DDT's.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

     The following suggestion list has been accumulated  from  various
sources,  including  SPRs  and  DECUS  sessions.   The appearance of a
suggestion on this list does not necessarily mean  that  DIGITAL  ever
intends to implement it.

     1.  Implement a byte typein and typeout facility.

     2.  Implement sorted and block-structured symbol tables.

SUMMARY


7.0  SUMMARY

     DDT is a symbolic assembly language debugger for the DECsystem-10
and  DECSYSTEM-20.   DDT provides many debugging facilities, including
breakpoints, program single-stepping, and the ability  to  examine  or
deposit  programs  or  data  symbolically.   The  source  file DDT.MAC
assembles into the following different versions of DDT:

TOPS-10         TOPS-20         FUNCTION

VMDDT.EXE       UDDT.EXE        Brought in by the DDT command.
DDT.EXE         SDDT.EXE        DDT with system symbols.
FILDDT.EXE      FILDDT.EXE      For EXE or binary data files.
DDT.REL         RDDT.REL        Relocatable user DDT.
EDDT.REL        EDDT.REL        Exec mode DDT.
  --            MDDT.REL        TOPS-20 monitor process DDT.
  --            KDDT.REL        TOPS-20 monitor specific EDDT.

     DDT version 41 is a significant development release with many new
features,  including  KL10  model  B extended addressing support, 2020
support, native mode FILDDT on TOPS-20, and many minor enhancements to
make the debugging process easier.


                               WARNING

               A FEW OF THE NEW FEATURES IN DDT 41  ARE
               NOT COMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF
               DDT.  SOME  COMMANDS  THAT  WORKED  WITH
               PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF DDT MAY NOT WORK OR
               DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH  DDT  41.   SEE
               SECTION 2 FOR MORE INFORMATION.



     DDT 41 supercedes all  previous  versions.   It  runs  under  all
supported monitors, and has been tested under TOPS-10 6.03A, and under
TOPS-20 releases 3A and 4.  All patches  published  through  31-Dec-78
have been incorporated into DDT 41.

     For DECsystem-10 sites, DDT is  documented  in  the  DDT  manual,
which  is  part  of  volume  9 of the TOPS-10 Software Notebooks.  The
manual   can   also   be   ordered   separately   as   order    number
DEC-10-UDDTA-A-D.

     For DECSYSTEM-20 sites, DDT is documented in the  TOPS-20  User's
Guide,  which  is  part of volume 1 of the TOPS-20 Software Notebooks.
The User's Guide can  also  be  ordered  separately  as  order  number
AA-4179B-TM.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


8.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     Most of the external changes in DDT 41 are new features that make
the  debugging  process  easier.   Refer  to  the file DDT41.MAN for a
detailed description of all new features.


                         INCOMPATABLE CHANGES

               SOME OF THE CHANGES  TO  DDT  MAY  CAUSE
               COMMANDS   THAT  WORKED  UNDER  PREVIOUS
               VERSIONS  OF  DDT  TO  NOT  WORK  OR  DO
               DIFFERENT   THINGS  WITH  DDT  41.   THE
               FOLLOWING  LIST   DESCRIBES   ALL   SUCH
               CHANGES.   PLEASE BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
               THIS LIST BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO  USE  DDT
               41.





8.1  36-Bit Addresses

     All addresses used by DDT are now 36-bit numbers,  including  the
current  location  counter ".".  Commands like "/" that take addresses
as arguments will now take all 36 bits of the argument as the  address
to be used.

     This change can cause  DDT  to  type  "?"  unexpectedly  on  some
commands  that  worked  with  previous versions of DDT.  The following
typescript illustrates a typical sequence  that  performs  differently
with DDT 41:

        FOO/   <old contents>   -1,,TEXT<tab>
        777777,,TEXT/   ?
        777777,,TEXT+1/   ?

The  user  obviously  expected  to  open  location  TEXT,  but  DDT 41
interpreted the entire expression as an  address  and  opened  a  very
large nonexistent address.  Another example is:

        DISP/   10327,,17346   $$Q/   ?   .=17346,,10327

In  this  case, the user wanted to follow the address in the left half
of location DISP, but ended up looking at a huge address instead.  The
$$Q means "the last quantity typed out with the halves swapped", which
has non-zero bits in the left half.  The  .=  verifies  that  this  is
indeed what has happened.
DDT41.DOC -- Changes from DDT 37(201)/40A(220) to DDT 41(265)  Page 12
EXTERNAL CHANGES


     If DDT types "?" when it should have typed  real  data,  and  you
suspect  that you may have ended up at a huge address, you can type .=
or linefeed to verify whether or not this has indeed happened.  If  it
has,  the  command  ,./  (three  adjacent keys on most terminals) will
quickly get you to the corresponding address with a zero left half.

     You can get DDT to ignore the left half  of  the  argument  to  a
location  opening  command  such  as  /  or  tab  by including a space
somewhere in the argument.  Space means to retain the left half of the
current location when opening a new location.  For instance, the first
example above could have been done as follows:

        FOO/   <old contents>   -1,,TEXT<space><tab>
        TEXT/   ANDI 360732(16)
        TEXT+1/   CONSZ 30,500000(14)

This command sequence would deposit -1,,TEXT in location FOO, but open
location 0,,TEXT, since the left half of the current address "." is 0.
Another example is:

        LOOP1+3/   PUSHJ P,ERROR   JRST PAT..<tab>
        PAT../   0

In this example, the user wanted to deposit a JRST PAT..  at  LOOP1+3,
and  then open location PAT.. to write a patch.  However, the user did
not have to include an  explicit  space  before  the  tab,  since  the
argument  to  the tab already contained the space between the JRST and
the PAT...  In fact, this kind of example is  exactly  why  space  has
been implemented as a "retain the current section" command.

     The ramifications of 36-bit addresses are more complex  than  can
be  described  in this short summary.  Refer to the file DDT41.MAN for
complete documentation.



8.2  Auto-typeout On Breakpoints

     The command to set a location to  type  out  automatically  on  a
breakpoint has changed, as follows:

Old way:

                A,,B$B  or  B(A)$B

New way:

                A<B$B

This  command  means  to  set a breakpoint at location B, and type out
location A symbolically every time the program  hits  the  breakpoint.
If the old-style command is typed to DDT 41, it will be interpreted as
a command to set a breakpoint at the full-word address A,,B, which  is
usually illegal.

KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES


9.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     The following list is currently incomplete.  It will  be  updated
before DDT 41 is finally released.

     The  following  is  a  complete  list  of  all  known  bugs   and
deficiencies in DDT 41 as of 1-Mar-79.

     1.  DDT does not detect many illegal commands,  for  example,  18
         octal  is  accepted  and  treated  as 20 octal.  DDT does not
         detect arguments to commands which are ignored, e.g., $23Q is
         the same as $Q.

     2.  The commands $<CR>, and $<LF> do not detect  the  attempt  to
         recall more than was saved.

     3.  When looking at user rather than exec  memory  (e.g.   n$mU),
         the AC's still come from CRSHAC rather than the user pages.

     4.  $X cannot handle the INIT MUUO in user mode.

     5.  Rubout, CTRL/U, and CTRL/W  are  not  handled  properly  when
         ASCII  or  SIXBIT  text  is typed in (the " and $" commands).
         Text may be stored in memory even if it is rubbed out later.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


10.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

10.1  TOPS-10

     To install DDT version 41 on your system, copy the files DDT.EXE,
VMDDT.EXE,  FILDDT.EXE,  DDT.REL,  EDDT.REL,  and  DDT41.MAN  from the
distribution tape to SYS:.

     The  batch  control   file   DDT.CTL   contains   all   necessary
instructions  to  assemble  and load DDT.  It will normally have to be
modified slightly to correspond to the installation configuration.



10.2  TOPS-20

     To install  DDT  version  41  on  your  system,  copy  the  files
UDDT.EXE,  SDDT.EXE,  FILDDT.EXE,  RDDT.REL,  EDDT.REL,  MDDT.REL, and
DDT41.MAN from the distribution tape to SYS:.  This  can  be  done  by
mounting the tape labelled Distribution Tape on MTA0:, then typing the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 2
     RESTORE DSK*:<*>*DDT.EXE (TO) SYS:*.*.-1, -
     DSK*:<*>*DDT.REL (TO) SYS:*.*.-1, -
     DSK*:<*>DDT41.MAN (TO) SYS:*.*.-1
     REWIND

     To rebuild DDT from sources, mount the tape labelled Distribution
Tape on MTA0:, then type the following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 3
     RESTORE DSK*:<*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     CTRL/C
     !At this point, you should TYPE DDT.CTL to see what it does.
     SUBMIT DDT.CTL/TIME/RESTART

     The batch control file DDT.CTL contains the procedures  necessary
to  rebuild  DDT from sources.  It may have to be modified slightly to
run at your installation, so you should type it to see  what  it  does
before typing the SUBMIT command above.

        Lost instruction in EDDT for KI-10's. Suppress address breaks
        in fetch and store logic. If $$X'ing (or $W'ing (searching)
        or $Z'ing (depositing)) and user types a ? then give a quickie
        typeout status. Second field test for TOPS-10 7.00.

256     RDH     17-Apr-79
        Random version 41 bugs (in particular $P of a breakpoint caused
        by XCT'ing a breakpoint location failed). Handle ERCAL/JMP on
        $P. Handle INIT UUO.

257     JNG     21-Apr-79
        Convert $U command to function codes.

260     RDH     13-May-79
        Add ADR$V command to "watch" a location and report any change in
        its contents (ADR defaults to last location opened).

261     RDH     22-May-79
        Stupid little bugs.

INTERNAL CHANGES


        XJRSTF and friends want all 36 bits of PC flags, not just the
        left-most 18 bits. $I+3 is 36-bit PC flags, $I+4 is 36-bit PC.

263     RDH     16-Jul-79
        More stupid little buggies. In particular, n$P broke.

264     DZN     25-Oct-79
        Replace SUB in LOOKDN with equivalent code that doesn't overflow.

265     DZN     6-Nov-79
        Remove multiply-defined globals $nB, $I, $M when KDDT and MDDT are
        loaded together.
