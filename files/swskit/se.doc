     To set up SE,  you must define EDITOR: to be TVSM.EXE, TVINI: to be
the area on which  the TVSM.INI file resides, TVBACK: be  defined as the
area you want your commands saved on (usually PS:),  and SE: to be where
SE.HLP and  SUPER-EDITOR.TEC are. Look at SE-LOGIN-COMMAND-FRAGMENT.CMDS
for an example.

     To  learn  the editor, you  can most easily read the help text   by
typing ESCape   Control-question-mark     (on    a  VT100)   or   ESCape
Control-underscore (on a  VT52 or  VT100).  There is a readable  version
called SE-READABLE-HELP.TXT that can be typed directly, outside of SE.

     The  insert command in TVSM.INI should be changed   to  insert your
initials if you intend to use SE's "patch" command.  From that point on,
files are edited by typing

@EDIT filename

      And created by typing

@CREATE filename

     For  a  list of  what  files   are associated  with  the SE,   read
SHIP-LIST.TXT.
