ALU (Automated Library Utility) DOC File.
3 March 1982

ALU is a program which helps keep track of modifications to
a set of program sources in one or more libraries.  It is
intended to handle multiple developers working on the same
sources, keeping track of which developer is editing which
source, and preventing inadvertant confusion from simultaneous
edits.

The documentation presently available is ALUDOC, and this
describes the ALU as used by the TOPS20 monitor development
group.

The sources are:

ALUPRM.MAC - project-specific data.
ALU.MAC - the program.

Depending on the state of certain assembly flags, ALU will call
REDIT for some functions.
