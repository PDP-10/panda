MAIL.DOC -- Changes from V4(6) to V5(6)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

MAIL is a program which allows users to send messages to other  users.
Messages  sent  by MAIL are stored in the receiver's disk directory so
that they may be referenced when convenient.

MAIL version 5(6) runs on Release 5 of TOPS-20.

MAIL depends on the programs INFO and MAILER  to  perform  its  stated
tasks.  Also, the program RDMAIL is used by message recipients to read
messages.

MAIL is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.

There are no external changes in MAIL for Release 5.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run MAIL

MAIL consists of one file, MAIL.EXE.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing MAIL

Mount the tape labeled  Installation  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the

4.3  Files Needed to Build MAIL

MAIL is built from the following file:

     MAIL.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building MAIL

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT MAIL.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


4.5  Special Considerations

running.    Ordinarily,   these   two   system  programs  are  started
automatically by SYSJOB.
