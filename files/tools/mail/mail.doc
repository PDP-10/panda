MAIL.DOC -- Changes from V4(6) to V5(6)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

MAIL is a program which allows users to send messages to other  users.
Messages  sent  by MAIL are stored in the receiver's disk directory so
that they may be referenced when convenient.

MAIL version 5(6) runs on Release 5 of TOPS-20.

MAIL depends on the programs INFO and MAILER  to  perform  its  stated
tasks.  Also, the program RDMAIL is used by message recipients to read
messages.

MAIL is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in MAIL for Release 5.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.1  Files Needed to Run MAIL

MAIL consists of one file, MAIL.EXE.

4.3  Files Needed to Build MAIL

     MAIL.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

automatically by SYSJOB.
