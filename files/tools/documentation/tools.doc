The TOOLs tape being distributed with  TOPS20  contains  software  tools
which  are  in  constant  use during the development, documentation, and
testing of DECSYSTEM20 software.  There have been many customer requests
for  access  to  these  tools.   Because  they are merely tools used for
creating software products and not software  products  themselves,  they
have  neither  funded  development nor funded support.  However, because
they are important for the development  of  products,  these  tools  are
normally kept up to date.

The tools tape has been created to  provide  customer  access  to  these
software  tools.   The  software  on this tape is customer installed and
customer supported.  There is no direct nor implied  commitment  on  the
part  of  Digital  to  support  these  software tools.  Nor is there any
commitment that  the  documentation  enclosed  accurately  reflects  the
software functionality.

The software described in this document is furnished  under  the  TOPS20
license  and  may be used or copied only in accordance with the terms of
such license.

There are twenty-nine software tools on the tape, each  contained  in  a
separate DUMPER save set.

     1.  ALU -- Automated Library Utility

         ALU is a program which helps keep track  of  modifications
         to  a set of program sources in one or more libraries.  It
         is intended to handle multiple developers working  on  the
         same  sources, keeping track of which developer is editing
         which source, and preventing  inadvertent  confusion  from
         simultaneous edits.

     2.  BLIS10 -- BLISS-10 Compiler

         This is a copy of the BLISS-10 compiler which  runs  under
         the compatibility package with TOPS-20.
                                                                  Page 2


     3.  CHANS -- Channel Statistics Tool

         CHANS types out information about  any  of  the  following
         items:   CDB's,  KDB's, UDB's, disks, or tapes.  Including
         such things as Address, channel, controller, unit, device,
         device  type,  and device status.  CHANS assumes a printer
         type terminal, but has a command for videos.

     4.  CISTS -- Computer Interconnect (CI) Status Utility

         CISTS types out  status  information  about  the  Computer
         Interconnect  (CI).   The  information  includes the KLIPA
         microcode version as well as status  information  on  each
         remote  node  known to other monitor.  There is no command
         scanner, simply run it and  a  snapshot  of  some  of  the
         monitors  CI  data is typed out on your terminal...  Other
         information  provided   includes   the   port   statistics
         currently available, and the packet statistics to date.

     5.  DOBOPR -- Dump-On-BUGCHK Control Program

         The DOBOPR program is used  to  set  certain  BUGCHKs  and
         BUGINFs  dumpable.   It can also be used to set structures
         on  your  system  dumpable.   DOBOPR  can  also  take   an
         immediate  dump of your system (it will produce the FORCED
         BUGINF and then dump it) if you have hung jobs/forks.

     6.  ENQTST -- ENQ%/DEQ%/ENQC% Testing Program

         ENQTST can be used to verify the use of the ENQ% facility.
         It is a COMND% oriented program.

     7.  EXEC MODS -- MIC, PCL, and Command Editor modifications to
         the EXEC

         This save-set  contains  files  to  modify  the  Executive
         Processor  to add MIC, PCL (Programmable Command Language)
         and Command Editor functionality.

     8.  FORMAT -- Disk Formatting Tool

         This tool formats RP04 and RP06  packs  to  be  used  with
         TOPS-20 file systems.

     9.  KRYPTN -- Encrypted Password Converter

         This program is used to easily convert all  the  directory
         passwords  on  an existing file structure to the encrypted
         form when a structure is first changed  to  use  encrypted
         passwords.
                                                                  Page 3


    10.  MAIL/MAILER/RDMAIL -- The Old Mailers

         The  MAIL/MAILER/RDMAIL  programs  are   no   longer   the
         supported  mailers  for  TOPS-20.  MS/MX are the supported
         mailers.  However, these programs are  still  provided  as
         tools in case your site depends on these programs.

    11.  MONRD -- Program to Read Words from the Running Monitor

         MONRD is used to type out locations in  the  monitor.   If
         the locations are in the JSB area or PSB area, the program
         is able to find the proper data for any desired  fork  and
         job  number.   MONRD  requires  the existence of a "MONRD"
         JSYS, which is inserted by the SYSDPY program.

    12.  QUETST -- QUEUE% JSYS Test Program

         QUETST is a program to demonstrate the capabilities of the
         QUEUE%  JSYS and also is an example of how the QUEUE% JSYS
         may be used in a user program.

    13.  REDIT -- Source Update Utility

         REDIT is used to duplicate changes which have been made in
         source  files.   It is typically used to maintain multiple
         sets  of  sources  for  different  versions  of  the  same
         program,  and  can  conveniently allow changes made in one
         set to be distributed and  selectively  incorporated  into
         other sets without the use of common "grandfather" files.

    14.  REV -- Program to Modify File Attributes

         REV allows the user to modify the various file  attributes
         of a particular file, or a group of files.  It enables the
         user to modify the bits in the FDB easily, without  having
         to write a program to perform this function.

    15.  RMTCON -- Remote Console Diagnostic Services

         RMTCON provides a simple user  interface  to  perform  the
         Ethernet   MOP  Read-Identity,  Read-Counters,  and  ASCII
         Console Carrier functions to remote dependent nodes.

    16.  SCM -- File Compare Program

         SCM is a native  mode  file  compare  program  similar  to
         FILCOM.   SCM  runs faster than FILCOM but is lacking some
         of the features.
                                                                  Page 4


    17.  SED -- Screen Editor

         SED is a full-screen editor for TOPS-20 and TOPS-10, which
         was  developed  by  an  engineer  at  DEC.   It  has  many
         sophisticated features which allow easy editing  of  files
         on  display  terminals,  yet its performance is quite good
         for an editor of its power.  SED can easily be made to run
         on  almost  any display terminal.  Full documentation, for
         both the installer and the user, is included.

    18.  SSU -- Session Support Utility Allows you to have multiple
         sessions   on  the  same  serial  line  for  VT300  series
         terminals.

    19.  SYSDPY -- System Display Utility

         This  program  displays  a  variety  of  system   oriented
         information  on  a CRT.  The display is kept up to date at
         periodic intervals.  It is a useful tool for the  system's
         programmer  when  evaluating  system  load  and/or per-job
         resource usage.

    20.  TSTATS -- TCP/IP Status Utility

         This tool  prints  a  line  containing  information  about
         certain TCP/IP links.

    21.  TTYINI -- Teletype Initialization Tool

         This program displays and sets the terminal  type  running
         terminal.   TTYINI  lets  the user change default terminal
         settings and default terminal type for a specified  series
         of terminals.

    22.  TYPVFU -- TYPe VFU

         TYPVFU is a program that can be used to  dump  information
         from a VFU file.  When examined with the DUMP command, the
         user is told the line stops for all channels as  indicated
         by the VFU file.

    23.  UNITS -- Disk Units Listing Tool

         UNITS is a program to print statistics  on  all  the  disk
         structures  that the system has physical or logical access
         to.  Some of the information included are:  Status,  type,
         channel,  drive,  controller,  name  and  the drive serial
         number for each drive seen.
                                                                  Page 5


    24.  USAG20 -- Program to Process USAGE Files (COBOL)

         USAG20 is a program to read and process the USAGE  entries
         and  to  summarize  them  in  a  report.   This program is
         intended to serve as  an  example  of  how  this  type  of
         application  can  be  done.   It  is  NOT  intended  to be
         applicable to all installations.

    25.  USAH20 -- Program to Process USAGE Files (FORTRAN)

         USAH20 is identical in function to USAG20, except that  it
         is written in FORTRAN.

    26.  VNP36 -- Virtual Network Program

         VNP36 is a rebuilt version of the Virtual Network  Program
         to work with the version of KL microcode shipped with this
         package.   This  is  only  useful  if  you  are  a  DECnet
         customer.
