2.0  GENERAL INFORMATION


Version V7E of the BLISS-10 compiler is a maintenance release in  that
it  contains  many  patches  to  fix known bugs.  It also contains new
functionality which could affect some current  programs.   BLIS10  V7E
will  build  field-image  APL  (version  1A)  and  field-image FORTRAN
(version 5A) with edit 623  installed.   BLIS10  V7E  will  not  build
field-image BASIC-PLUS-2/20 (version 1A) or its associated RMS.  These
products suffer from the functional modifications outlined in  section
6.0   below.   This  document  contains  information  on  installation
procedures and known bugs and deficiencies.



3.0  LIST OF FILES INCLUDED IN BLISS-10 7E


See BLIS20.LOG for a complete list of all of the files included in the
version V7E release of the BLISS-10 package.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


Install  BLIS10.EXE,  BLIS10.ERR  and  SIX12.REL  on  <SUBSYS>.    Put
BLIS10.HLP on HLP:  and BLIS10.DOC on DOC:.
BEWARE FILE FOR BLISS-10 V7E                                    Page 4


5.0  RECOMMENDED PATCHES AND KNOWN DEFICIENCIES


See BLS7E.DOC for a list of known bugs and deficiencies.


Appended to this .BWR file is FORTRAN PCO  #271  which  is  edit  623.
This  edit  must be installed in FORTRAN V5A before it can be built by
BLIS10 V7E.



6.0  GENERAL WARNINGS


The control file BLIS20.CTL which builds  BLISS-10  creates  the  .DOC
file  for  BLIS10  under  the  name  BLIS10.DOC.   That file is on the
release tape as BLS7E.DOC.


The .REL files for the BLISS-10 compiler produced  by  BLIS10  7B(222)
have  a  creation  date  in  1966.  This is caused by a DATE75 problem
between  the  DECsystem-10  BLISS-10  compiler  and  the  DECSYSTEM-20
compatibility  package.   The contents of these .REL files are correct
and have been tested.


Two modifications to the way BLIS10  parses  MACRO  definitions  could
adversely affect existing programs:

     1.  As outlined in BLS7E.DOC, a macro whose  last  lexeme  begins
         with a ? must not end with the $ which ends the macro.

             MACRO A = ?..X$;

         must be written as

             MACRO A = ?..X $;

     2.  A macro formal in a lexeme beginning  with  $,  will  not  be
         recognized so concatenation will not be performed.

         Example:

             MACRO A(X) = ?..X $;
             A(N);

         will expand into "?..X", not "?..N".

         To circumvent this, define

             MACRO IDENT (B) = B $;
             MACRO A(X) = IDENT(?..)X $;

7.0  NEW FEATURES, DIFFERENCES OBSERVABLE TO THE USER


The new features and enhancements  in  version  V7E  of  the  BLISS-10
compiler are documented in BLS7E.DOC.



8.0  RESULTS OF TESTING


BLIS10 V7E has been tested in-house at our Marlboro facility, used  to
build  our BLISS-based products and exercised by in-house BLISS users.
All that we guarentee  is  that  BLIS10  V7E  will  build  field-image
FORTRAN V5A (with edit 623) and field-image APL V1A.

                        **********


[SYMPTOM]
 
 
 
 
The compiler loops in FORTD in ONLIST looking at a doubly nested implied
DO  used  to  READ a double subscripted array.  This ONLY happens with a
compiler built with a BLIS10 NEWER than 7B(222).
 

                        **********


[DIAGNOSIS]
 
ONLIST is called by QUALIFY to see if a  variable  is  on  the  DOCHNGL.
Unfortunately  there  is  no  extended  optimizer block and therefore no
DOCHNGL to search in the DO node of an implied  DO.   The  SRCOPT  field
which  would  point  to  the  optimizer  block  is 0.  It seems that the
register allocation  in  all  BLIS10s  from  7B(222)  BACK  generates  a
sequence  of  instructions that calls ONLIST with a zero list pointer so
that it exits immediately.  BLIS10 7C(224) generates different  register
usage  and  passes  ONLIST garbage which it dutifully chases infinitely.
This occurs during statement optimizations (in LABLAD)  and  not  global
optimizations so the IMPLDO flag is not set.
 

                        **********


[CURE]
 
Modify QUALIFY to call ONLIST (searching the DOCHNGL) only if SRCOPT  is
non-zero which means that we are NOT in an iolist.
