REDIT DOC File
3 March 1982

REDIT is used to duplicate changes which have been made in source
files.  It is typically used to maintain multiple sets of
sources for different versions of the same program, and
can conveniently allow changes made in one set to be
distributed and selectively incorporated into other
sets without the use of common "grandfather" files.

The documentation on REDIT is REDIT.MEM, and this text
is also available from the HELP command in REDIT.

Some use of REDIT is also discussed in connection with ALU.
