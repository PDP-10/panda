            to  close  the  compound expression before the ELSE was encountered.

            identifier  of  illegal  type (such as a special operator).  If this

%UID    0   Undeclared identifier

?ULA   40   Illegal up level addressing
            Specifically, when the compiler sees a reference to an identifier of
            type  local,  formal, function, structure formal, or a bind while is
            not a compile time constant expression, it tests to insure that  the
            identifiers  have  not been declared at a level outside (lower than)
            that of the latest routine declaration.   Since  all  of  the  above
            types  are  referenced via the stack, displays are required in order
            to keep track of the stack reference pointer at outer levels.  Since
            the displays are not available within a routine, it is impossible to
            reference specific stack positions which  are  set  aside  in  outer
            blocks.

            A special unary operator appeared in the text, and was not  followed
            by  an  open  parentheses.   The  special  unary  operators  are the
            character manipulation functions (SCANN,  REPLACEI,  etc.).   MACHOP
            not  in  declarations, and the special functions SIGN, ABS, FIRSTONE
            and OFFSET.  Since the special  unary  operators  are  analogous  to
            function  calls,  they  require  an  argument  list.  Since they are
            special functions, there is no machine address associated  with  the
            name, therefore, the name alone has no meaning and is illegal.
