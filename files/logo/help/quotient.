quotient  -- Operation, two inputs.  Infix: /
     The output of this procedure is the quotient of the  two  inputs.   If
     both inputs are integers, the output is also an integer; the remainder
     of the division is lost.  If either input is not an integer, the  quo-
     tient can include a fractional part.  Therefore, these two are not the
     same:
