test  -- Command, one input.
     The input must be the word  true  or  the  word  false.   The  command
     remembers  its  input  for  use  in a later iftrue or iffalse command.
     This is an alternative to if which is useful if  several  instructions
     are  to  be  made  conditional  on the same condition.  The remembered
     truth value is local to the current procedure, if any.
