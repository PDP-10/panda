stop  -- Command, no inputs.
     This command is used in user procedures which are  meant  to  be  com-
     mands.   It stops the user procedure.  (Note that it does not stop all
     running procedures.  If user procedure A runs user procedure B, a stop
     command  in  procedure B returns to procedure A, which continues after
     the point where procedure B was invoked.)
