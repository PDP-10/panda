plist  -- Operation, one input.
     The input must be a word, which is a name.  The output is the property
     list  of  the  specified name.  Note: the output is actually a copy of
     the property list.  The real property list is not a  Logo  list.   Any
     later  changes to the properties of the specified name will not change
     the list which was output by an earlier plist.
