go  -- Command, one input.
     This command can be used only inside a procedure.  The input must be a
     number.   The same number must appear at the beginning of some line in
     the same procedure.  (This line number is otherwise ignored.) The next
     command  executed will be the one on the indicated line in the defini-
     tion.  Note: there is always a better way to do it.  If you have  pre-
     viously  programmed  in  BASIC, your only hope of ever really learning
     how to program computers is NEVER EVER to use the go command!
