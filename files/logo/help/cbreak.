cbreak  -- Command, one input.
     The input must be either the word on or the word off.  If the input is
     on,  your terminal is placed in cbreak mode, which means that what you
     type is made available to your program every  character,  rather  than
     every  line.   This must be done before the readchar procedure, below,
     will work.  This facility is good for writing video game  programs  or
     text editors.  While in cbreak mode, echo is turned off also.
