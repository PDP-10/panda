splitscreen  -- Command, no inputs.  Abbreviation: split
     This command applies only to the Atari display  turtle.   It  restores
     the  normal  text display at the bottom of the screen, undoing the ef-
     fect  of  the  full  command.   On  other  displays,  fullscreen   and
     splitscreen  are equivalent; they make the entire screen available for
     graphics, with text superimposed in a display-dependent area.
