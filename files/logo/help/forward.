forward  -- Command, one input.  Abbreviation: fd
     The input is a number, the distance you would like the turtle to move.
     For a floor turtle, the unit of distance is however far the turtle can
     travel in 1/30 second.  For a display turtle, the unit is one  dot  on
     the  TV screen.  (Note: on some displays, one dot horizontally may not
     be the same length as one dot vertically.  The setscrunch command  al-
     lows  you  to  control  the  relative  sizes  so that squares come out
     square.)  The turtle moves in whatever direction it is  pointing  when
     you use the command.
