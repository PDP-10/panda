oflush  -- Command, no inputs.
     Normally, when you tell Logo to print something, the printing  is  not
     done  right  away.   Instead, Logo remembers everything you tell it to
     print, and the printing is done all at once  the  next  time  Logo  is
     waiting  for  you to type something.  This arrangement makes Logo much
     faster than it would be if everything were printed  immediately.   The
     oflush  command  tells  Logo to print whatever you've previously asked
     for right away, without waiting.
