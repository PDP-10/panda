memberp  -- Operation (predicate), two inputs.
     If the second input is a word, the first  input  must  be  a  word  of
     length one (a single character), and the output is true if and only if
     the first input is contained in the second as  a  character.   If  the
     second  input  is  a list, the first input can be any Logo object, and
     the output is true if and only if the first input is a member  of  the
     second input.  (Note that this is member, not subset.)
