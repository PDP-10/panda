setcolor  -- Command, two inputs.  Abbreviation: setc
     This command applies only to the Atari display turtle.  The first  in-
     put  must be an integer between 0 and 3.  If the input is nonzero, the
     second input specifies the color for the pen selected by the first in-
     put.  If the first input is zero, the second input specifies the back-
     ground color for the color graphics display.  The second input is  ei-
     ther  an  integer between 0 and 15, which is a color number, or a list
     of two integers, in which case the first is a  color  number  and  the
     second is an intensity number, an integer between 0 and 7.
