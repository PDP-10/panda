memtrace  -- Command, no inputs.
     This command is meant to be used only for debugging Logo  itself.   It
     is  explained here only for completeness.  After this command is used,
     every allocation or deallocation of memory, and every character parsed
     by  the  interpreter, types an incomprehensible message at your termi-
     nal.
