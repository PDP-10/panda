close  -- Command, one input.
     The input must be a file descriptor.  The file is closed.   This  must
     be done when you've finished reading or writing the file.

     Sample program:

     make "fd openwrite "outfile
     fileprint :fd "Hello.
     close :fd

     This will create a file named outfile containing the word Hello.
