trace  -- Command, no inputs.
     This command is used for debugging your Logo programs.  After you  use
     this  command,  every time a user-defined procedure starts or stops, a
     message is typed at your terminal naming the procedure and its  inputs
     or its output, if any.  The message is indented according to the depth
     in procedure calls.
