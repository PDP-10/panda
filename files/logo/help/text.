textscreen  -- Command, no inputs.  Abbreviation: text
     This command applies only to the display turtle.  It  temporarily  re-
     moves  the  turtle  display  from the screen, making the entire screen
     available for text display.  The commands fullscreen  and  splitscreen
     will  restore  the graphics display.  Note:  On the Atari display, the
     picture on the screen is  remembered,  so  that  when  you  return  to
     fullscreen or splitscreen mode, the picture returns to the screen.  On
     other displays, the picture is forgotten, and you return to  an  empty
     graphics screen.
