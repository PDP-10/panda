setscrunch  -- Command, one input.  Abbreviation: setscrun
     This command is used only for display turtles.  The input  must  be  a
     number.  The vertical component of turtle motion is multiplied by this
     number before each motion is taken.  If squares come out too  wide  on
     your screen,  you  should increase the number; if too tall, you should
     decrease it.  (You can also use setscrunch to deform the turtle's  mo-
     tion  on purpose, so for example a circle program will draw an ellipse
     instead.)  The initial scrunch value depends on the terminal  you  are
     using:  for  the Atari and the Gigi, it is around 0.8 (your particular
     computer center will adjust this for the particular  TV  monitors  you
     use),  but  for  the  ADM, Tektronix, and Sun, it is 1.0 because these
     terminals display the same size steps horizontally and vertically.
