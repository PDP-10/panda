count  -- Operation, one input.
     The input may be any Logo object.  If the input is a list, the  output
     is a number indicating the number of members in the list.  (Note: only
     top-level members are counted, not members of members.  The  count  of
     the list

          [[This is] [a list]]

     is 2, not 4.)  If the input is a word, the output  is  the  number  of
     letters  (or  other  characters) in the word.  Remember that in Logo a
     number is just a particular kind of word, so the output from count can
     be manipulated like any other Logo word.
