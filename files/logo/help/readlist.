readlist  -- Operation, no inputs.  Abbreviation: rl
     Logo waits for a line to be typed by the user.  The  contents  of  the
     line  are  made into a list, as though typed within square brackets as
     part of a Logo instruction.  (The user should not actually type brack-
     ets  around the line, unless s/he desires a list of one element, which
     is a list itself.)  That list is the output from the operation.
