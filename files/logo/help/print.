print  -- Command, one input.  Abbreviation: pr
     The input, which may be a word or a list, is printed on the  terminal,
     followed  by  a  new  line character.  (That is, the terminal is posi-
     tioned at the beginning of a new line after printing the object.)   If
     the  object is a list, any sub-lists are delimited by square brackets,
     but the entire object is not delimited by brackets.
