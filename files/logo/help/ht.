hideturtle  -- Command, no inputs.  Abbreviation: ht
     This command applies only  to  the  display  turtle.   It  erases  the
     display  of  the turtle itself from the screen, so that only the lines
     drawn when the turtle moves are visible.  The display is  faster  when
     the turtle is hidden (only slightly faster on the Atari, but much fas-
     ter on other terminals).  Also, once a graphics program  is  debugged,
     it  may  be  prettier to watch without the turtle visible.  (Note:  On
     the Tektronix display, the turtle is never visible, because the termi-
     nal cannot erase selectively.)
