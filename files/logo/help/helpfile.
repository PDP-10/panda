Logo is an interactive procedural programming language designed
for education.  This TOPS-20 implementation was ported from Unix;
documentation is available by reading the file PS:<LOGO>LOGO.MANUAL.

To find out about a particular Logo primitive, use the "describe"
command with the name of the primitive as its input, e.g.
	describe "print
prints a description of the print command.

The command to leave Logo is
        goodbye
and can be abbreviated to
        bye

Enjoy!
