gprop  -- Operation, two inputs.
     Both inputs must be words.  The first is a name, and the second  is  a
     property  name.   The output is the value of the indicated property of
     the indicated object.  It is not an error if there is no such  proper-
     ty; the output in that case is the empty list.
