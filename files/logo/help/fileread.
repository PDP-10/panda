fileread  -- Operation, one input.  Abbreviation: fird
     The input must be a file descriptor, previously  output  by  openread.
     The  procedure  reads one line from the file.  The output is the line,
     in the form of a list.  (That is, the output is the file  line  as  if
     enclosed in square brackets in a program.)  If the end of the file has
     been reached, the output is the empty word.  If the file line contains
     mismatched brackets, trouble may result.
