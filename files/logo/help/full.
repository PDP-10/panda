fullscreen  -- Command, no inputs.  Abbreviation: full
     This command applies only to the Atari display turtle.  It  eliminates
     the use of the bottom four lines of the screen to display the commands
     you type; instead, the entire screen is available to show the  picture
     drawn  by the turtle.  However, you can no longer see what you're typ-
     ing.  The command may be used after the picture is already drawn;  the
     part  "hidden"  by  the  text  at the bottom of the screen will become
     visible.   On  other  displays,   fullscreen   and   splitscreen   are
     equivalent;  they  make  the entire screen available for graphics, and
     text appears on the bottom line (Gigis)  or  superimposed  (ADMs),  or
     somewhere.
