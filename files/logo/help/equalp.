equalp  -- Operation (predicate), two inputs.  Infix: =
     The two inputs to this procedure may be any Logo objects.  If they are
     numbers,  then  the  output  is  the word true if they are numerically
     equal, false if they are numerically unequal.  If either input is  not
     a  number,  then the output is the same as for the procedure is: it is
     true if the two inputs are identical, false if not.  For example,  the
     numbers 2 and 2.0 are numerically equal, but not identical.
