setqpause  -- Command, no inputs.
     This command tells Logo that from now on, the  system  quit  character
     should  pause, and the system interrupt character should return to to-
     plevel.  This is the reverse of the usual interpretation.   This  com-
     mand  is  provided  for  people whose systems or keyboards make one of
     these characters easier to type than the other.  In particular,  under
     Eunice there is only an interrupt character, not a quit character.
