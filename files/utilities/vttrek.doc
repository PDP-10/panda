1.0  INTRODUCTION

TREK is a space game for up to 8 players.  It is  designed  for  VT100
terminals that have the Advanced Video Option.  Each player plays at a
separate terminal logged into a separate job.

The game represents a battle between the United Federation of  Planets
and the Klingon Empire.  The object is to drive the opposing side from
the galaxy by capturing planets and destroying enemy bases and ships.

The first player to run the game selects either a tournament game or a
random  game.   In  tournament  games the locations of objects are the
same from run to run.  To select a tournament  game,  enter  a  number
from 1 to 9.  Enter any other character to select a random game.

A list of ships in play is displayed, followed by a list of  available
ships.  Select the ship you want to control by entering its initial.

If you attempt to enter the game when another player is  starting  up,
you may be asked to stand by until the other player is finished.



2.0  STARTUP SITUATION

Each side begins with four starships and four  starbases.   The  ships
operate automatically until a player enters the game and takes control
of one of them.  The player retains control until he or she leaves the
game or until the ship is destroyed.

Ships operating automatically perform normal ship functions.  They may
attack  enemy  ships,  capture  planets,  and come to the aid of other
ships.  They may also attack enemy bases when their side controls more
than eight planets.

The starbases serve as refueling points for the ships, as do  captured
planets.   Bases  and  captured  planets attack enemy ships and inform
friendly ships when enemies are nearby.

Captured planets look for opportunities to rebel.  The fewer bases and
planets you control, the more likely your planets are to rebel.



3.0  STARSHIP BASICS

The ship you command is an object in three-dimensional space.  You may
rotate and move the ship anywhere in the galaxy.

The galaxy has no external reference grid.  The location of an  object
in space is always given relative to the ship you command.

An object location is given as a bearing, an elevation, and  a  range.
The  bearing  and elevation are simple spherical coordinates.  Looking
forward along the long axis of the ship, the bearing is the  angle  to
the  left  or  right (negative on the left, positive on the right) and
the elevation is the angle up or down (negative is down,  positive  is
TREK Version 2.0                                                Page 2


up).   The range is the absolute distance from your ship to an object.
See the diagram in Appendix A.

Each ship begins with 3000 units of ship  energy  and  2000  units  of
shield  energy,  although  the  total may be somewhat less at the time
control is taken.  Ship energy is expended when  the  ship  is  moved,
when  weapons  are  fired,  or when energy is transferred from ship to
ship.  Shield energy is expended when the  shields  absorb  hits  from
enemy  weapons.   The  shields require at least 100 units of energy or
they collapse.  When shields are down the effect of enemy  weapons  is
doubled.   Energy  loss  continues until ship energy goes negative and
the ship explodes.

Ships  may  be  refueled  at  starbases  or  friendly   planets.    In
emergencies energy may be transferred from ship to ship.



4.0  STARSHIP COMPONENTS

4.1  Warp Drive

The warp engines move the ship  forward  or  backward.   The  distance
moved  depends upon the warp factor.  Initially, the distance is equal
to 2 to the power of the warp factor.  Warp 0 moves the ship  1  unit,
warp  9  moves  the  ship  512  units.   You  can change the distances
associated with the warp factors.

The energy cost is  computed  in  milliunits  equal  to  the  distance
squared.



4.2  Directional Computer

The directional computer controls the orientation of the ship.  It  is
activated  whenever  the ship is rotated.  Changing the orientation of
the ship changes the relative location of every other object in space.



4.3  Targeting Computer

The targeter controls, among other things, the  direction  of  weapons
fire  and  long  range  sensor scans.  It is analogous to a gun turret
that can be aimed in any direction relative to  the  ship.   When  the
ship  orientation  changes the target orientation also changes, except
when the target is locked on an object.



4.4  Sensors

The ship has short range sensors that scan in every direction and long
range sensors that scan in the target direction.
TREK Version 2.0                                                Page 3


4.5  Library Computer

The library computer maintains a catalog of the last  known  positions
of  objects.   The  library represents a pool of information shared by
all of the ships on  a  side.   Initially  the  library  contains  the
locations  of  your  starbases and the ships on your side.  Thereafter
any object scanned by the sensors is automatically cataloged into  the
library.  Stars and planetary interceptors are not cataloged.



4.6  Target List

The target list connects the sensors and the library with the targeter
and  the  directional  computer.   The target list contains up to four
objects obtained from either the sensors or the library.   Coordinates
from  the  list  can  be  fed directly into the target and directional
computers by referencing the number that precedes the list entry.



4.7  Weapons

The ship is equipped with phasers and photon torpedoes.  Both  weapons
apply  energy  to  a  target  that  must  be  absorbed by the target's
shields.  Phaser energy may be anything from 1 to 1000 units  (default
is 200 units).  Torpedo energy is fixed at 200 units per torpedo.

Phasers have a maximum range of 1024 units.  Torpedoes have a  maximum
range of 2048 units.

Phasers have a firing cost computed in milliunits equal to the  phaser
energy  squared.   In  addition, there is a time delay in milliseconds
equal to a hundredth of the firing cost to allow the phasers  to  cool
and recharge.  Torpedoes have a fixed launch cost of 20 units.



5.0  THE CONSOLE

5.1  The Viewer

The viewer at the top of the screen displays  the  forward  view  into
space  along  the  long axis of the ship.  The cursor in the center of
the viewer is the 0,0 point for bearing  and  elevation  measurements.
If  the target is within the range of the viewer but not at the center
it is displayed as a second cursor.

The numbers along the top and bottom of the viewer frame  are  bearing
angles.  The numbers along the sides are elevation angles.

See Appendix B for a description of objects  as  they  appear  in  the
viewer.
TREK Version 2.0                                                Page 4


5.2  The Message Area And Status Line

The message area at the lower left contains a status line and a  blank
area  for  messages.   The  target list is displayed here.  The status
line contains displays for ship energy, shield energy and status,  and
warp factor.  The shaded field is the command echo area.



5.3  The Command Keypad

The command keypad at the lower right corresponds to the VT100 numeric
keypad.



6.0  THE COMMANDS

There are immediate commands and common commands.  Immediate  commands
are  executed  as soon as the command key is pressed.  Common commands
are executed when the EXE key is pressed.  To repeat a  command  press
the EXE key again.




6.1  Immediate Commands


SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN (PF1-4)

    The four function keys at the top of the keypad activate the short
    range  sensor.  A short range scan scans space for any object of a
    given type within 1024 distance units of the ship, as follows:

            PF1  -  Scan for Federation starships and bases
            PF2  -  Scan for Klingon cruisers and bases
            PF3  -  Scan for planets and interceptors
            PF4  -  Scan for any of the above

    Note that stars are ignored by the short range sensors.


LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN (LR SCAN)

    The LR SCAN key activates the long range  sensor.   A  long  range
    scan scans at the target coordinates for the nearest object within
    2048 distance units.



6.2  Common Commands

The common command format is a command abbreviation followed  by  one,
two,  or  no  modifiers.  The modifiers may be one or two numbers or a
combination of a direction and a number.
TREK Version 2.0                                                Page 5


The command abbreviation is one or two letters.  If  the  abbreviation
contains  two  letters,  both  must be entered.  A command can also be
entered from the keypad by pressing the appropriate keypad key.

Numbers, including the minus sign, can be entered from the  keypad  or
from the main keyboard.  Two numbers are separated by a period, a tab,
or a space.

If two numbers represent bearing and elevation,  the  bearing  is  the
first number, the elevation the second number.

Directions are entered using the arrow keys or  the  special  function
(PF)  keys  on  the keypad.  The PF keys are functionally identical to
the arrow keys.  You may enter direction  and  number  or  number  and
direction.

The keypad ERA key erases a single field.

The common commands are listed below:

AL  LIST ALL OBJECTS IN THE LIBRARY

    Moves objects from the library to the  target  list  and  displays
    them four at a time.  If more than four objects are available, the
    keypad MOR key will flash.  Press the MOR  key  to  see  the  next
    group of four.

    LO nbr    Lock on a listed object

MO  MOVE THE SHIP (ROLL THE SHIP)

    Move the ship forward (up arrow) or backward (down arrow),  or  in
    the  target  direction,  or  toward  a  listed object, or toward a
    specific bearing and elevation.  Movement is at the  current  warp
    factor.   Warp  factor  may  be  overridden  if  moving forward or
    backward.

    Movement left or right is interpreted as a  roll  (rotation  along
    the long axis) and must be followed by an angle.

    MO        Move in the target direction
    MO up w   Move forward (warp is optional)
    MO dn w   Move backward (warp is optional)

RA  SOUND RED ALERT

    RA, YA, SA, and AS relay your ship status to other ships  on  your
    side.   RA (red alert) and AS (request assistance) cause automatic
    ships to come to your aid.  If an automatic ship finds  you  in  a
    low  energy  state,  it  will  transfer energy to you.  YA (yellow
    alert) and SA (secure from alert) cancel RA and AS.

RE  REFUEL AND RELOAD

    Ship must be within 512 units  of  starbase  or  friendly  planet.
    Refuel  rate  is  500  units  at  starbases, 250 units at planets.
    Reload rate is 5 torpedoes at starbases, 3 torpedoes at planets.

RF  RAPID-FIRE WEAPONS

    Turns the keypad phaser and torpedo keys into immediate  commands.
    When  in  rapid  fire  mode,  pressing  the  phaser  key fires the
    phasers, pressing the torpedo key fires torpedos.   Phaser  energy
    up to 1000 and torpedo count up to 3 may be specified.  Default is
    200 unit phaser and 1 torpedo.  Enter RF alone to return to normal
    mode.

    RF ph to  Set rapid fire for given phasers and torpedos
    RF        Return to normal mode.

RO  ROTATE THE SHIP

    Rotate the  ship  in  a  specific  direction,  or  in  the  target
    direction, or toward a listed object, or toward a specific bearing
    and elevation.  Rotation in a direction  may  be  followed  by  an
    angle.   If no angle is given, the targeter searches for an object
    in the given direction and the ship is rotated toward the  nearest
    object found.

    RO        Rotate in the target direction
    RO dir    Find a target and rotate toward it
    RO dir a  Rotate by an angle in a direction
    RO nbr    Rotate toward a listed object
    RO b e    Rotate toward a bearing and elevation

RT  REFRESH WITH VT100 SELF-TEST

    Invokes  the  VT100  self-test  routine  and  then  refreshes  the
    display.   If  the  terminal  appears  to  be displaying the wrong
    characters, RT may correct the problem.

SA  SECURE FROM ALERT (SEE RA)

SE  SEND A MESSAGE

    Send a message to one or more ships.   Displays  initial  of  your
    ship and a colon in the message area.  Enter your message and type
    EXE to send.  Keypad ERA key cancels the command.

    SE ALL    Send to all ships

    SE init   Send to ship with init as its initial

SH  SET SHIELDS

    Raise  or  lower  shields.   Set  shields  to  a  specific  energy
    (difference is taken from or released to ship energy).

    SH up     Raise shields
    SH dn     Lower shields
    SH ene    Set shield energy

ST  DISPLAY ACTIVE STATUS

    Displays  the  number  of  ships,  bases,  and  captured   planets
    available to each side.

TA  SET THE TARGET

    Target on an object, or in  a  specific  direction,  or  toward  a
    bearing  and  elevation.   TA  followed by no modifiers causes the
    targeter to search the viewer for the object that  is  closest  to
    the  current  target  position.   TA with a direction but no angle
    restricts the search to  the  given  direction.   If  the  current
    target  position  is  not  within  range of the viewer, TA with no
    modifiers resets the target to 0,0.

    TA        Search for a target
    TA dir    Search for a target in a specific direction
    TA dir a  Move the target by an angle in a direction
    TA nbr    Set the target at a listed object

TO  FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES

    Fire from 1 to 3 torpedoes in the target direction.  Default is  1
    torpedo.

    TO        Fire one torpedo
    TO nbr    Fire a number of torpedoes

TR  TRANSFER ENERGY TO ANOTHER SHIP

    Up  to  1000  units  of  ship  energy  may  be  transferred.   The
    transferring ship first targets on the receiving ship.  Both ships
    must have their shields down.  If the receiving ship  has  shields
    up, the shields will absorb the energy.

The angles OBA, OAP, and PAB are right angles.

The object P is in the upper left of the viewer.  Its bearing angle is
the angle between lines OA and OB.  Its elevation is the angle between
lines OP and OA.  Its range is the distance from point O to point P.

In this case P has a negative bearing (to the left of  center)  and  a
positive elevation (above center).

9.0  APPENDIX C - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VERSIONS 1.0 AND 2.0

The main difference between versions 1.0 and 2.0  is  that  all  eight
ships are active in version 2.0.  In version 1.0 the only active ships
were the players' ships.  As a consequence, the objective of the  game
has  changed  in  that  it is officially over when all four ships on a
side have been destroyed.

Another major difference is that a new queueing mechanism is  used  in
version  2.0.   The  old  routines  sometimes  caused  illegal UUOs or
lock-ups with LED L1 on.  This shouldn't happen in version 2.0.

Other differences are that planets can rebel in version 2.0,  you  can
set  rapid-fire  mode  phaser  energy and torpedo counts, messages are
displayed at the bottom of  the  screen,  and  there  are  a  few  new
commands.   The  ST  command has changed its meaning from self-test to
status.  RT replaces it.  Also, an option has been added  that  allows
the KL version of the game to be compiled to run on KI's.
