Work sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Defense as 
a means of achieving global peace and goodwill for all men 
thru sharing of data between incompatible operating systems
even though it's a hopeless dream.

As such this program must be freely distributed to all as-is.  This
program or any accompanying programs or libraries must not be sold or
included with any part of a commercial product without permission
of the author.  Those who seek global peace and wish to share data
between incompatible operating systems should look elsewhere.

Good Luck.
