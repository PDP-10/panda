!& Setup IMAIL Library:! !S Define things needed by IMAIL
Makes a q-vector & RCUSR code containg code that & RCUSR
needs to run.!

!*This is code to do RCUSR, given address of string in ac3, returns user number
  as value (ac1).  Returns 0 on failure (monitor feature: rcusr doesn't change
  ac3 if fails) !

!& Immediate Mail:! !S Send mail using IPCF mailer
Accepts text of message as string numarg and list of recipients in current
buffer.  Recipients are in format USER@SITE, crlf, USER at SITE, crlf.  Local
recipients are delivered locally and deleted from the buffer.!

!* This function works by writing a temporary file called
   MSG.TMP, then invoking a program as an inferior which sends
   to MAILER to get the mail delivered, and returns a message
   by RSCANing a string, and initializing rscan buffer to read!

!* Format of MSG.TMP file:
	word 0:	    FL%MM (bit 0) -- suppresses mailer from generating a header
			(this bit does not exist on all systems)
	word 1-n:   list of user numbers to send to.
	words n+1,n+2:	both 0 -- delimits recipients from text
	rest of file:	message in asciz.    !
