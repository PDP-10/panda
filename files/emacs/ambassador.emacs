!~FILENAME~:! !Commands to use Ambassador keypad!
AMBASSADOR

!& Setup Ambassador Library:! !S Sets up Ambassador keypad.
Makes the obvious assignments to the arrows, less obvious
ones to everything else.  ESC becomes a prefix character, with
dispatch in .Y; ESC [ becomes another prefix character,
with dispatch in .Z; ESC O becomes another prefix character with
dispatch in .D.  Q.P gets a modified Prefix driver to make
this all work.  If $Ambassador Setup Hook$ is defined, it is run
afterwards to make any additional assignments or changes; it can
access the function Set Ambassador Key (q.v.) by running MS, e.g.
<number>MS<function> .  This function also reprograms some keys.
Some default sequences are reprogrammed to help eliminate ambiguity.  Note
that this will wipe out any sequence which may have been on the key to
start with.  New sequences will be put on the PERIOD, 0, and ENTER
keys on the keypad; the SEND key (in simultaneous mode only); and the
shifted and unshifted MOVE UP and MOVE DOWN keys (though the controllified 
sequences used for 'zooming' are still standard).!

!& Ambass Prefix Character Driver:! !S M.P for Ambass: handles prefix chars.
Given a q-vector as argument, it reads a character
and returns the q-vector element it selects.
Difference between this and standard is that ? is not treated as help.
The character read is left in Q..1.!

!Set Ambassador Key:! !C Assigns a function to an Ambassador special key.
For best results, use ^R Instant Extended Command to invoke this.
String Argument is name of function to assign.
You will be prompted to type the key to put the function on.

Alternatively, if you are calling this from your init file, you can pass
the key as a numeric arg.  In this case, the keys are coded as follows:

1-12   ==> PF1 thru PF12
13-24  ==> shift-PF1 thru shift-PF12
25-30  ==> ERASE thru SEND (along top row)
31-39  ==> keypad 1 thru keypad 9
40-42  ==> keypad . thru keypad ENTER (bottom row of keypad)
43     ==> MOVE UP
44     ==> MOVE DOWN
45     ==> shift MOVE UP
46     ==> shift MOVE DOWN
47-49  ==> shift ERASE, shift DELETE (red), shift INSERT respectively

You may also pass the function DEFINITION as a pre-comma arg, instead of
passing the function NAME as a string arg.!

!^R Skip to Character:! !^R Skips to target character.
Skips forward to nth (or 1st) occurrence of next char typed.
Backward if arg is negative.  Edit bit on target ignored.
Repeat Skip with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.
Pre-comma arg gives char to search for (instead of reading it).!

!& Skip to Char:! !S Implements Skip to Character.
This is a separate routine so that ^R Skip to Character can
do the Auto Push Point Option.  Optional pre-comma arg is the target char,
post-comma arg is repeat!

!* The var Skip/Zap State Vector is a 7-elt Q-vector that saves state of
skip/zap commands: <target char, repeat arg, zapflg, skip prompt, backskip
prompt, zap prompt, back zap prompt>.  The repeat arg is saved so you know the
direction of the skip/zap.  Zapflg is 1 if the command was Zap, 0 if Skip.
This all permits Repeat Skip/Zap to work.  The prompts are for M.I to use if
user is slow.!

!^R Reverse Skip:! !^R Search backward for target char.
I.e. like a backwards ^R Skip to Character.  Repeat with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.!
