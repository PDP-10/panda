This is a list of all the files composing EMACS as distributed,
what they do, where they belong on a Twenex system,
and where they are copied from on the MIT-AI machine.

Not all of the files are essential for actual use.  The ones which are
absolutely necessary are TECPUR.EXE, EMACS.EXE, EMACS.:EJ, TWENEX.:EJ,
BARE.:EJ, and EMACS.INIT.  These suffice for minimal use of EMACS,
though other files are needed for running the EMACS.CTL file to
produce those.  The other EXE files are needed if you want to run
them, and the other :EJ files are libraries which are needed if you
want to use them.

Many of the other files are documentation of one sort or another.
None of it is directly needed for using EMACS.  You can judge for
yourself how important it is to have the documentation of any
particular thing.

Many other files are source files.  Source files of assembler code are
not very important, but source files of TECO code are necessary for
customization's sake.  It is important to be able to look at the
definition of a function so as to design a small change to it.
So these source files should be kept on line if that is at all
possible.

In any case, you are urged not to give anyone a copy of EMACS by
dumping what you have on line.  Copy the tape instead.  But especially
do not give out a copy of what you have on line if that isn't all
the files that were on the tape.  It is very important not to give
anyone a version of EMACS which is sans source files, since that
prevents him from customizing.
