Has anyone found the file EMACS;EMACS GUIDE useful lately?

I speculate that it may be so long that it is not worth while
for anyone to actually print it out, that it is always easier
for everyone to get a printed manual, and that the file can
be flushed.

If you think the file is worth keeping, please let me know.

Subject: Changes in EMACS 162, now NE on AI.
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

*) You can now specify which command should exit an incremental search
(and not do anything else when it exits the search) by setting the
variable Search Exit Char to the desired 9-bit character.
The default is Altmode.  Commands whose definitions are to indirect to
the specified character also exit the search.  C-@'s default
definition is now indirect to C-Space, so if you set Search Exit Char
to 300 octal, both C-@ and C-Space will be search exit characters.

I urge everyone to try out the use of C-@/C-Space as exit character,
because eventually I'll conduct another poll and perhaps change the
default.  Try any other characters you might like, also.

*) The new command Correct Spelling corrects spelling through the
entire buffer.  The new command Command to Spell passes its argument
to the SPELL job as a command.

*) The major modes for various assemblers, such as MIDAS, PALX, FAIL
and MACRO-10, now each run their own mode hooks.  Previously they all
ran MIDAS Mode Hook.

*) The completing reader has various extensions intended to allow
completion on more kinds of things.  Completion of buffer names and
variable names may be available soon as an optional library.

*) The new hook Exit to Superior Hook is executed before EMACS returns
to its calling job.  Unlike Exit Hook, this new hook is in addition to
all normal actions.

Subject: Search terminators
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

    Since searches already set the mark, why
    not use C-@ to terminate?

Several people have said things like this, and I don't know what to
make of it.

Searches do (often) set the mark -- because (we hope) that mark is
going to be useful.

My best guess for what these people are saying is that there is no
need for a special character to terminate the search, because the C-@
command can be used; the fact that it sets the mark as well is
unimportant.

However, this would make the mark left behind by the search
inaccessible.  Were you overlooking this?  Or are you saying what
you are saying because you think the mark left by the search itself is
not useful?  If so, do you think the search should not set the mark?
(That can be turned off by setting Auto Push Point Option to a very
large number.)

Several other people suggested using ^G to terminate the search.
Since ^G is now the way to abort a search, it seems this would either
require a different way to abort a search (what would that be?) or
else there would be no way to abort a search.

C-] has also been suggested.  I think that is asking for trouble:
the same sort that Altmode causes, but more serious.

Subject: poll on C-S, C-O, and Return
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

What do you think of these two suggested changes to EMACS?

1) Make Altmode not be ignored when it terminates a search, so that it
would still function as a Metizer.  Some other character would have to
be provided instead as a way of terminating a search and doing nothing
else.  C-D was suggested, but I don't like it.  I'd like to hear other
suggestions.

2) Make C-O do what C-A Tab C-O does now.

3) Also, how many people now find it useful or desirable that Return
eats up blank lines?  This feature was invented in the days when
terminals did not have insert/delete line.

Subject: data compression and redundancy, or, why SUPDUP is like a finely crafted buggy in an age of autos.
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC, INFO-MACSYMA at MIT-MC


Waiting for my screen to fill at 300 Baud takes so long,
I forget what I was about to do!

I like the idea of Huffman encoding the output through a STY.  This
requires knowledge of data characteristics on the character level.  A
simple frequency counting program can get this kind of knowledge.
Encoding schemes that use knowledge of the data on the highest level
should be even better.  Intuition is the only way I know to get this
level of knowledge.

I am hacking a system where the host and the terminal both know about
jobs and data contained in jobs.  The terminal is a microComputer with
"virtual memory" which gets "paged" in from the current job at 300
Baud, perhaps using Huffman encoding.  Instead of filling the screen
itself, the host sends a brief message saying "put datum X on the
screen now".  If datum X is not locally stored, the terminal will
reply "send text of datum X", and keep a copy of datum X for possible
future re-display.  Also, the system could anticipate the user.  Thus
EMACS could send me more than the current screenful when I select a
buffer, on the reasonable assumtion that I will want to see it soon.

I suspect that anticipating transmission and eliminating repeated
re-transmission wins more interaction speed than Huffman encoding does.

All display is done locally.  This means EMACS sends portions of it's
buffers, not display codes, and MACSYMA sends craftily encoded
SEXPR's, not pretty human-readable stuff.  So the terminal has to know
about EMACS and MACSYMA internal formats and display algorithms to be
useful here.

Now (at last) my questions:

How can I deal with unsolicited type-out, without doing :GAG and ^_R?

What are the display algorithms for EMACS and MACSYMA?

What other programs or classes of programs should the terminal know about?

Has anyone done (or thought about) anything similar?

From: Richard M. Stallman <RMS at MIT-AI>
Subject:  Many new features
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

These features are mostly due to people at the Canadian
Defense Research Establishment Atlantic.

MAZLIB is cleaner now, and well documented.  Try it.
MAZE.MAZE is the new data file for the maze.

The SORT functions sort in reverse order if given
a numeric arg.

FORTRAN mode now provides for files with and without tabs after
statement numbers, and for converting between the two formats.
Also, it can insert or remove sequence numbers.  It contains a Fortran
Data mode for editing files of fixed-column data.

SAIL mode now has an indenter, based on that of PASCAL mode.

The new library MODE2 provides for having two mode lines: the
actual EMACS mode line and one additional line stolen from the text
area.  You can select various options for information to display in
that area.

The new library NCOLUMNS can take single-column text and turn it into
any number of columns, but cannot turn it back.  This is different
from the library COLUMNS, which can turn single-column text into
two-column text or the opposite, but cannot handle more than two
columns.  Perhaps someone would like to write a new COLUMNS which
replaces both of these.

A new hook, Exit to Superior Hook, is executed before EMACS returns to
its superior job.

Twenex Only changes:

The new library BUGHUNT modifies the comment commands to put your name
at the front of each comment you edit.

The new library MOVE contains functions for moving pages or paragraphs
between files, supposedly more convenient than doing so by killing and
switching buffers.

The new library PERSONAL contains functions for keeping track of your
projects, phone conversations, and notes to yourself.

SYSTEM uses the superior EXEC if possible rather than an inferior,
and has new functions Check Job, Check System Job,
Check Log File, Logout, Enable, and Disable.

EFORK: ^R Invoke Inferior can be called as a subroutine.

The new library FDB is useful for examining occult parts of the status
of a file, on Twenex.

There is now a BASIC20 mode, and also a PCL mode for editing command
files.

The new library TALK contains functions for initiating and accepting
links with other users.  Only for Twenex.

The VT132 terminal is supported.  There is a library NVT132 for it
analogous to NVT52 and NVT100.

Two new hooks, Exit to Inferior Hook and Return from Inferior Hook,
are executed respectively before EMACS runs an inferior and after
EMACS starts up again.  Not all invocations of inferiors call these
hooks; those which are expected to be momentary and involve no
keyboard input generally do not invoke the hooks.

it will be at the beginning after the M-Y.

C-U C-X ( now appends to the last defined keyboard macro,
repeating its definition at the beginning.  It is just like
typing C-X ( and then retyping the previous keyboard macro
definition yourself, but omitting the C-X ), so that you
can add to the end of the definition.

a defun is any character whose Lisp syntax is "(", appearing
in column 0.  It does not have to be literally a "(".

The names for the built-in TECO functions are always accessible.
You do not have to load the BARE library by hand to use them.

All error messages pertaining to auto saving now say which file
the problem was encountered with.

In an incremental search on a printing terminal, you can type
C-L to reprint the line which the search has reached so far,
and it will not exit the search.

On Twenex, a file's major mode will be defaulted from its extension
even if the file has a local modes list (which fails to specify
the major mode).

the word with one of them by typing the corresponding digit.

Subject: Updates to Emacs MODLIN library
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

If you are a user of the MODLIN library (defines an alternate Mode Line 
handler), you'll note some slight differences ... 

* The presence or absence of the keyword `NoWrite' in the mode line,
  which used to reflect the setting of Inhibit Write, has been
  discontinued. Instead, Visit File Save Old is reflected as follows...

  SaveOld   = Emacs will automatically write the file under these conditions.
	      (Visit File Save Old is negative)
  NoSaveOld = Emacs will assume without asking that this buffer is not 
	      something you want saved even if it is modified when you try
	      reading a new file into this buffer. (Visit File Save Old is 0)
  (nothing) = Emacs will query if you try to read a new file into this buffer
	      and buffer is modified. (Visit File Save Old is positive)

* If buffer bounds are narrowed, the keyword `Narrow' will appear.

* The occurrence of the keyword `ReadOnlyFile', `ReadOnlyBuf' or 
  `ReadOnlyFile/Buf' signifies that the file, buffer, or both are readonly.

* When visiting a ">" or "<" file, or a ".0" or ".-2" file on non-ITS,
  the true version number of the file will be shown after the filename
  as something like "=nnn". Eg, if KMP;FOO 3 were read in by naming FOO >,
  the mode line will display "KMP;FOO > =3"

* Redundant redisplays of the modeline (ie, redisplay where nothing has 
  changed to warrant a redisplay) should be less frequent.

These changes are installed on ITS.

Note to offsite Emacs maintainers:
  The source file <EMACS>MODLIN.EMACS.63 exists on XX for exportation to 
  non-ITS sites, but is not installed as <EMACS>MODLIN.:EJ yet, since it
  will not run in versions of Emacs older than Emacs.154 and Emacs.150 is
  still the standard. When the new version of Emacs comes up on XX, 
  <EMACS>MODLIN.:EJ.63 should be generated for use.

Subject: default for Auto Save Filenames on ITS
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

The default FN1 for auto save filenames on ITS is now
_SAVnn, where nn is the buffer number of the buffer being saved.
The buffer number is the number printed by C-X C-B at the
beginning of the line describing the buffer.  This is so that
auto saves from different buffers do not clobber each other.

In older versions of EMACS, which do not have the feature just
installed to insert the nn, the default will be _SAV00.

If you set Auto Save Filenames yourself you will not see the change
unless you set the FN1 to something six characters long ending in 00.

Subject: New Lisp Indentation Format
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

In Emacs 154 (now NE on all sites), a new Lisp indentation style is in use.
The changes have been provided for the following reasons:

 * To increase the ease with which stylized ``LispMachine-style'' Lisp 
   indentation can be obtained in a user-programmable way.

 * To lessen loss of screen space due to indentation. This indenter is much 
   more conservative about the amount of indent it gives to many kinds of
   expressions.

 * To enhance error checking. Many kinds of Lisp forms (DO, PROG,
   LET, LAMBDA, ...) have some number of leading forms, treated specially,
   followed by some trailing forms, called the body. Common forms of this
   type will now have expressions in their bodies indented slightly 
   differently than their leading expressions to accentuate the separation.
   eg,
		(DO ((X 0 (1+ X)))
		    ((= X 10.))
		  (PRINT X))

What follows is information about how customized indentation.

* How Indentation is Decided

  The old indentation algorithm is first run, and a tentative indentation
  is computed. Then a hook is run to allow selection of a different 
  indentation if appropriate.

* User-Level Variables

  Lisp ... Indent where the '...' is replaced by the name of a Lisp operator,
	defines a special indentation method for that operator. Eg,
	Lisp PROG Indent controls how PROG's indent. The value of variables
	may be a string, in which case they will be called to compute
	the indentation (argument conventions and return values to be discussed
	later) or a number indicating one of several common operations.

	      n				description

	  -4 or less	undefined
	  -3		don't indent any special way unless the value of
			 Lisp Indent DEFanything dictates that we should.
			 This is the default for unknown functions.
	  -2		don't indent any special way.
	  -1		indent as a DEF-form. If this is the 2nd line of the
			 definition, indent specially. Otherwise, indent under
			 preceding line.
	   0 or more	indent as a special form, assuming that this form
			 has n leading expressions before its body. (eg, LET
			 and LAMBDA have 1 special expression for the bound
			 variable list, PROGN has none, DO has 2). These
			 special fields are indented normally. The first 
			 expression following these special ones is indented
			 specially. Expressions after that are indented 
			 under the previous line as normal.

	The variable Lisp PROG Indent is initially defined to run code so that PROG
	tags can line up right-justified. Variables corresponding to several
	of the common Lisp special forms are set up with non-negative values 
	corresponding to the indentation style suggested by their semantics.

  Lisp Indent DEFanything, if nonzero, will cause all operator names
	beginning with 'DEF' to default to definitional form style indentation
	(corresponding to a Lisp DEF... Indent variable of -1). Setting this
	to 0 will cause 'DEF...' operators to be indented specially only if
	they have associated Lisp ... Indent variables set up to cause such
	special indentation.

  Lisp Indent Offset (default 0), if nonzero, indent this many columns past
	the most recent unclosed "(" rather than worrying about indentation
	relative to arguments (this also bypasses special form hackery).
	If 0, normal Lispy indentation rules apply.

	NOTE: Although this variable has been present for a long time,
	      it has changed slightly. It used to measure offset from the 
	      right side of the paren. Now it measures offset from the left
	      of the paren. The change was made to provide greater flexibility
	      since formerly it was impossible to say you wanted to indent
	      just after the hanging open paren. 

  Lisp Special Indent Offset (default 2), is the offset from the hanging
	"(" which special form indentation uses. Eg, with the default setting,
	Emacs will indent under the "E" of "DEFUN".
  
* Low-Level Variables (primarily of interest to Emacs implementors)

  Lisp Indent Language contains a string (default "LISP") which is used
	to decide which lisp-like language is to be used. Other hooks key
	off of this string; ie, if the Indent Language is LISP, variables
	like LISP Indent Offset and Lisp PROG Indent will be looked for.
	If the language were Muddle, variables such as Muddle Indent Offset and
	Muddle PROG Indent would be looked for instead. Currently, Muddle mode
	doesn't use this feature, but perhaps it will in the near future.

	In the remainder of this description, only Lisp ... variables
	since they are the only ones which are currently useful to most users,
	but implementors should bear in mind that similar variables for
	other dialects may be defined if a local variable
	Lisp Indent Language is created with the appropriate dialect
	name as its contents.

  Lisp Indentation Hook holds the function which tries to determine how
	special forms should be indented. All of the effects described
	farther down in this description are dependent on its containing
	the default value. If you do not like the action of this hook,
	you may wish to put a null string in this variable to keep it 
	from doing anything -- effectively nullifying most of the changes
	described in this text.

* Extension Conventions (for sophisticated users only)

  Lisp Indentation Hook (or Muddle Indentation Hook or ...) must be 
	defined and must contain a string. Its args (,) are the
	position in the buffer of the most recent unclosed "(" and
	the buffer position of the beginning of the line to be indented.
	The buffer position of the cursor at the time the tab was typed
	is stored as an offset from Z in qZ, so Z-qZ is that buffer position.
	The hook should NOT modify the buffer. If it returns 0 or no value,
	it will be assumed that the horizontal cursor position (given by
	fsshpos) is to be used as the indetnation level. Hence, to indent
	under the "O" in PROG, it is sufficient to jump to that character in
	the buffer and return. Replacement of the pointer to the appropriate
	line will happen automatically later. If it returns nonzero, that
	value will be assumed to be the desired indentation. Returning
	negative values is undefined.

  Lisp ... Indent variables containing strings to be executed observe the

Subject: Changes in EMACS 154 (now NE on AI)
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

Incompatible changes (indicated by two *'s at beginning of item):
EVARS file and local mode list format,
Visit File Save Old vs. Inhibit Write,
Meaning of argument to C-X C-V or C-X C-F,
Meaning of Exit Hook,
Format of Prefix Char List.

*** Use ***

**) Visit File Save Old now controls whether visiting a new file causes
the old one to be saved.  If this variable is zero, the old file is
not saved.  If it is -1, then the old file is automatically saved.  If
the variable is 1, then you are asked whether to save.  The default
value is 1.  This variable replaces the old distinction between C-X
C-R and C-X C-V, which are now identical commands.

The variable Inhibit Write is no longer used for anything, though
it still exists to keep some old programs from bombing.  Find File
Inhibit Write no longer exists at all.

**) True read-only visiting is now implemented.  An argument to the
file-visiting command (C-X C-V or C-X C-F) is used to request this.
Either the buffer or the file can be read-only.  A read-only buffer
means that you can't insert or delete anything.  A read-only file
means you can change the text in the buffer, but it will not be saved
in the file unless you insist.  To insist, you type C-X C-S and answer
"Y" to confirm; absolutely nothing else will cause the read-only file
to be saved.

Normally what you get is a read-only file, whose buffer can be edited.
The command C-X C-Q (^R Set Read-Only File) can be used to switch
between the three modes (ordinary, read-only buffer, and read-only
file).

*) New self-documentation for recursive editing levels.
When you are inside a recursive editing level, Help ? mentions this
and tells you how to abort and how to exit, as well as listing the
Help options available.  A new Help option, Help R, gives the full
description of the command that got you into the recursive editing
level.

*) If the variable Auto Save All Buffers is nonzero, each auto save
will save whichever buffers need to be saved.  It is up to you to make
sure that the buffers are saved in different places, either by using
Auto Save Visited File, or by giving each buffer a different value of
Auto Save Filename (perhaps automatically in a Buffer Creation Hook).

*) EMACS remembers the current version number of each visited file,
and displays this in the mode line and in the printout from List
Buffers.

*) The Delete File command asks for confirmation if it is not sure
that you know what default filenames were applied to the filename you
specified.

*) M-X View Available Space prints out how many pages of space are
available in EMACS for more buffers or more libraries.

*) The character "#" now has the syntax of a prefix character in Lisp
mode.

*) ^R Indent for Comment now does not move comments that start with a
single semicolon in column 0.

*** Customization ***

**) The format of EVARS files and local mode lines has been changed to
allow variable values to be multi-line strings.

The value specified for a variable should now be either a number or a
string enclosed in doublequote characters.  Indentation before the
number or before the string is ignored.  To include a doublequote
character in the contents of the string, quote it with a  character.

Except for peculiar cases, old EVARS files and local modes lists still
work.  Peculir cases include string values which happen to begin with
spaces followed by a doublequote, or spaces followed by a digit.

The change applies only to values of variables.  Lines which specify
definitions for command characters are still single lines of TECO
code.

*) So that certain common forms of customization will not need to use
FS flags, there are now variables which you can use instead of certain
FS flags which people often set.  Setting the variable sets the FS
flag.  Setting the FS flag explicitly also works, but the value of the
variable does not change, so it is best not to mix the two styles of
use.

Here is a complete list of variables which control FS flags.  Not all
of these are new.

Auto Save Interval		FS ^R MDLY
Bottom Display Margin		FS %BOTTOM
Case Search			FS BOTHCASE
Cursor Centering Point		FS %CENTER
Display Mode Line Inverse	FS INVMOD
Display Overprinting		FS ^H PRINT and FS ^M PRINT
Echo Area Height		FS ECHO LINES
End of Buffer Display Margin	FS %END
Error Messages in Echo Area	FS ECHO ERRORS
Fill Column			FS ADLINE
Overwrite Mode			FS ^R REPLACE
SAIL Character Mode		FS SAIL
System Output Holding		FS TT PAGE (Twenex only)
Top Display Margin		FS %TOP

*** Extension ***

**) The format of the value of the variable Prefix Char List is
changed.  This should only affect people who create their own prefix
characters.  The purpose of the change is to allow for prefix
characters whose dispatch tables are kept in variables rather than in
q-registers.  The new format of the value is: any number of lines,
with a CRLF after each line, one line per prefix character.
Each line contains the name to be printed for the prefix character,
followed by two spaces, and the TECO expression which evaluates to the
dispatch table for the prefix character.  Look at the initial value of
this variable if this is not clear.

**) & Exit EMACS now calls the Exit Hook in addition to auto saving and
optional explicit saving.  The Exit Hook used to override them.

*) The TECO feature FS SUPERIOR is now fully exploited by EMACS.
Superiors can tell an EMACS to make space in the buffer, or to visit a
file, by following the protocol described near the end of TECORD.

*) M-X Describe can be given a precomma argument, which should be the
character number of a ^R command being described.  This is passed
along to any documentation-macros contained in the documentation
string.

*) FS TAB WIDTH now controls the distance between tab stops on
display.  By setting this to 10, you can view a file the way it would
look on Multics.

*) On Twenex, Return from Inferior Hook is called on return from an
inferior if Exit Hook is called before starting the inferior.

Currently, Autoarg mode means that digits typed before a control or
meta character count as an argument for it, but digits followed by a
non-control non-meta character are inserted.

Should Autoarg mode make the "-" character an argument character as
well as the digits?

In order to save beginners from having to know about FS flags, I'm
thinking of creating EMACS variables to control those FS flags which a
user might want to change in simple customization.  I don't want to do
it for all FS flags.  That would be costly, and many FS flags are not
useful except for people who are writing TECO code anyway.

Can you tell me which FS flags you think should be candidates for
this?

 In response to your message sent  3 Jan 1981 1301-PST

I have a library to use the Heath19 keypad and function keys.
To avoid conflicts with "regular" emacs keys, I implement them
as prefix characters on ESC and ESC-?, and designate one of the
keypad keys as a Meta-prefix to replace ESC.  The library lets
you assign any functions you want to the keys; the default
puts the obvious things on the arrow keys.  The library exists
as [sumex]<emacs>heath.*.  I'll be happy to send sources and
documentation to any requesting them.

Unfortunately, I believe that the codes that the H19 special keys
use would overide some of Emacs' standard key bindings (I think it
uses ESC-? as its prefix).  It could be designed, however, such that
if the character following the ESC-? is not a valid H19 code, it is
passed on to the Describe function.

In-Reply-To: Your message of 26-Nov-80 0253-EST

Barry,
     I agree that it would be nice to have ALGOL mode do better things
and that if someone implemented the features you mention, it would be
put to good use.  The problems are that the implementation would be of
nontrivial difficulty and that someone would have to devote time to it.
BEGIN and END cannot be recognized by TECO as brackets, as I understand
it, so <TAB> would have to be much hairier than for, say, LISP, in order
to work right.  (Besides which, there is no universal agreement about
indentation anyway.)
     While I would be willing in principle to work on it, there is NO
WAY I could assume such a responsibility at the present time, and I
don't know when that situation will change.  If you can find someone
else to do it, I'll be pleased.
     Sorry.

What if anything does Algol mode give me other than
the fact that it says "Algol" on my mode line and binding
TAB to indent-relative?  I am trying to use it to edit
my 6.001 labs, and it would be nice if I had an environment
full of useful functions for editing Algol code, i.e.
having TAB bound to the a function that knows how Algol
code should look, and an Indent Algol Region command.
I realize that there is not much demand these days for
a hefty Algol programming environment, but the fact
remains that every semester dozens of 6.001 students
will have to use a crufty Algol Mode.  I thought that
"Emacs Makes ALL Computing Simple".

Along the same lines goes the PASCAL Mode that the 6.030
students are using.  As a 6.030 UTA, I find that it would
make the structure of programs much clearer to the students
if PASCAL Indent Region did the right thing.  It doesn't
seem to know about the PASCAL keywords and how they
affect the formatting of a program.  I have never successfully
formatted a PASAL buffer with this; I usually have to
step down the lines and use TAB, correcting it when it
gets it wrong.

Right now C-T transposes the two characters around
the cursor, except at the end of the line.
In this it is compatible with M-T and C-M-T.
However, it might be more useful for C-T to
interchange the last two characters, always.
Do you think this change should be made?
Do you think that M-T and C-M-T should also be changed?
Whichever ones were changed, would only be changed
in the case when they have no argument.

The current definitions of M-T and C-M-T have the
property that repeating the command is useful, and is equivalent to
giving the command an argument.
So there is a conflict between utility of C-T, utility of
M-T and C-M-T, and compatibilit between them.

With the aid of Bill VanMelle, I have developed a package that can be
included in an EMACS.INIT file that adapts the Heathkit H-19 numeric
keypad to common emacs functions.  It works with minimal impact on bare
emacs, i.e. with no special libraries loaded.  Anyone who would like a
copy is welcome to have one, by sending me a request, with two caveats:

1) I do not warrantee nor will I support or make changes in it.

2) It currently works with the (very) peculiar 1200/150 split speed
modems we use here at Stanford. Specifically, this modem accepts
characters from the terminal at 1200 baud, buffers two characters, and
send them at 150 baud over the phone line. Since the heathkit keypad
sends 3 characters per key, the middle character (the "?") gets eaten
consistently by the modem. Consequently, the package looks for and
recognizes the first and last letters of the keypad codes. I am sure
that there is some simple change that will make the package consistent
with more rational modems;  however, having learned just enough of the
opaque TECO language to implement what I needed, I am not particularly
interested in figuring out what changes are required.

Currently, the package is conditionally invoked upon executing EMACS if
you are on an H-19 and on a 1200-baud line (presumed to be a dial-up).
This condition can be deleted if desired.

Incidentally, the keypad arrangement has proven quite convenient, and I
recommend it to other itinerant high-tech tinkerers. A map follows:

Subject: SPLIT library for editing very big files.
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

There is a new library SPLIT for operating
on files too big to load into EMACS.
It contains a command Split File which
divides such a large file into small enough subfiles,
and another command Unsplit File for putting the subfiles
back together.

On ITS, the subfiles made from FOO <anything> are called
FOO 1, FOO 2, FOO 3, etc.  Unsplit Files looks for the
same names to recombine.

On Twenex, the file FOO.anything.version is split into
FOO.1.1, FOO.2.1, etc.  After these have been edited
to get FOO.1.3, FOO.2.2 (for example), Unsplit File
combines those into a new version of FOO.anything

The subfiles are made about 50,000 words long,
and are divided at line boundaries.
There is no limit to the size of file which can be split.

EMACS 150 has the function Compare Windows, which is
what used to be in LSPUTL under the name Window SRCCOM.
It's very useful.  Also, now you can quit it at any time
and the pointers in both windows are advanced as far as
the comparison has gone.

The character "@" at the front of a line no longer indicates
a paragraph gap line by default.  In SCRIBE mode (which exists
on Twenex), the strings "@begin" and "@end" are recognized
as paragraph-separating lines, but not other lines which start
with "@".  This is so that there is no problem with the many
SCRIBE commands that are used within a paragraph.

TECO 1008 makes it possible to customize how cursor motion

EMACS will still handle motion within one line or down

moved over.

Other cursor motion can be handled by the string of TECO commands
stored in FS ^R TTM1.  It is up to you to define it.
I hope you will come up with useful ideas for what to put there
and try them out.  Then eventually I will look at what you've done

Reap File now only accepts one filename to reap.
It used to accept any number of filenames, terminated
by a null argument.  The change is to make it more like
most other commands.

To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS
The TeXmac library has become obsolete. I have moved all of its macros
(all 2 of them) into the TeX library and installed that. You should just
load TeX library now (or it will load for you when you enter TeX mode).
I will leave the TeXmac library around for about a week so that people's
packages don't break (at worst you'll have two copies of the macro in your
emacs if you explicitly load the TeXmac library) -- after that time, I'll
assume everyone has changed over and will delete TeXmac. 

For those with short memories, TeXmac had the macro support for automatically
generating \vbox's that know how to correctly preserve indentation of variable
width font displays.

Subject:  Word Abbrev mode
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS at MIT-AI

There is a new version of the WORDAB library with the following
changes.  This is now installed on AI, soon to move elsewhere.
For details on new commands, see their on-line documentation.

*  M-X Word Abbrev Apropos has been replaced by M-X List Word Abbrevs
   with a string argument.  M-X Insert Word Abbrevs can also take a
   string argument.

*  Keys (C-X C-A, etc.) are connected when the library is loaded, and stay
   connected outside of Word Abbrev mode:  you can define and expand
   manually if the system is too slow for automatic expansion to be
   tolerated.  Also, there is a new command M-X Expand Word Abbrevs in
   Region (queries like M-X Query Replace).

*  New option variable, Save Word Abbrevs, controls whether exiting EMACS
   will cause abbrevs to be saved if necessary.  1 => save all abbrevs
   on exit, -1 => just save incrementals, with default 0.

*  M-X Edit Word Abbrevs lets you re-edit to correct syntax errors.
   The error messages should be clearer too.

*  You can have word abbrev "macros", keyboard macros (or Teco code if
   you prefer) that can be "attached" to normal abbrevs, so that after
   those abbrevs expand, their attached macros are run.  E.g.
   "textmode" could expand to "-*-Text-*-" and then do a M-X Text Mode
   automatically.  Describe M-X Attach Word Abbrev Keyboard Macro for
   details.

One final question:  does anyone use abbrevs that are local to a file?

To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
CC: RLB at MIT-MC, INFO-TEX at MIT-MC, RIVEST at MIT-ML

I have created and installed a library called TeXmac for use in Emacs
to support useful operations on TeX code. Currently, the following
macros are all it contains:

[1] M-X Setup Indented TeX Display

    This macro will take a normally indented expression in a variable
    width region and set it up so that it will be output aligned similarly
    by TeX. *Only* the beginnings of lines will line up right. Example:
    The region must be placed around the area that is to be set up.
    This macro is primarily for setting up indented Lisp code in a variable
    width font. Requires a \noflash macro to be defined (see [3] below)

[2] M-X UnSetup Indented TeX Display

    This macro will convert a region of the buffer which has had
    M-X Setup Indented TeX Display run across it and turn it back into
    normally indented text. The cursor may be placed generally anywhere
    touching the \vbox{...} which is to be converted back.

[3] M-X Insert TeXmac Aux Macros

    Inserts macro definition for \noflash macro used by the output of
    M-X Setup Indented TeX Display. If the \noflash macro is found to be
    of general use to the TeX community, it may be moved into one of the
    TeX libraries, but for now you'll have to manually include its definition
    by running this macro at the top of your file.

I object, but propose that C-U C-T do the proposed operation.
I suspect that few people use the numeric arg to C-T (though they
may for M-T), or in any case seldom count off as muich as four
rather than just repeatedly typing C-T however many times.

Is there any way to get EMACS to use the physical tab stops in
the H19 (columns 9, 17, 25, etc.) when typing text that contains
tabs?  I am using an H19 at 300 baud and notice that EMACS types
spaces even when the text contains tab characters and the tab
stops being used by EMACS are identical to those used by the
terminal.  Getting EMACS to type the actual tab characters in the
text would seem to be a big help when one is limited to 300 baud.

Emacs does seem to echo the tabs when the text is first typed in,
but whenever it is re-displayed it then types 8 spaces per tab
character in the text.

Subject:  Modifications to TAGS
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC

The following changes have been made in the Emacs TAGS library:

People who do 1m.vTags Find File (default 0, same as before) will
now find that TAGS search over large tag libraries will not run out 
of core. Now what happens if Tags Find File is nonzero is a buffer
named *TagSearch* is used as a temporary during the search if the
file being searched is not already in core. This affects only 
M-X Tags Search, C-., and M-X Tags Query Replace. (If you do a search 
that uses this facility, you are advised to use M-X Rename Buffer to 
change the buffer name if you don't want the next such search to recycle
that space.)

Doing 0m.vTags Search Verbose (default 1) will suppress the filenames
from printing out as M-X Tags Search moves from file to file. 
M-X Tags Query Replace is not affected, since it is presumably more
interactive anyway; if there are enough people who want the same or another 
flag to affect that macro, as well, it can probably be arranged.

Some minor bug fixes. Tags will no longer accidentally err out due to
finding something in an invalid field in the tags file.

Should indented lines really start paragraphs?

Paragraph Delimiter is normally set so that they do.  Logically this
is the correct decision for unindented text.  However, making the
paragraph commands ignore indentation would enable them to recognize
paragraphs correctly in indented text.  This would also benefit the
sentence commands, which do not work well on indented text now that
they pay attention to all paragraph boundaries.  The cost would be
that if anyone uses indentation to indicate paragraphs and has no
blank lines between them, his paragraphs would not be recognized.
However, he could change Paragraph Delimiter back to its old default
value.

Subject: EMACS 145
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

EMACS 145 is now installed as NE on AI.
For the most part it merely incorporates the patches for 144.
However, there are these new minor features:

View Buffer now takesthe name of the buffer to be viewed.
A null argument means to view the selected buffer, as before.
Also, Backspace moves back by screens, as in View File
(which is used as a subroutine).

A new command, Insert Buffer, inserts the contents of another
buffer into the selected one.

A new command, Make Space, tries to free up space.
It offers to empty out the kill ring, to empty the undo
memory, and to delete the EMACS buffers created automatically
by TAGS, INFO, RMAIL, etc. (a separate offer for each such buffer).
Even if you say "no" to each of these offers, it frees up some
internal objects which you will not miss.

Backtrace now has a new command, ".", which returns to any frame
at any PC.  First select the frame to return to, then type ".".
You can then position point at the PC to return to, in a
recursive editing level.

The commands List Commands, List Subroutines and List ^R Commands
have been flushed to save space, on the grounds that their output
has become so verbose that nobody would want to use them.
You can get a similar effect from doing Apropos with a null argument.

Subject: Proposed new commands, and sundry remarks.
To: (BUG ZWEI) at MIT-AI, (BUG EMACS) at MIT-AI
CC: GLS at MIT-AI, INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

Comments solicited on the following suggestions (which are NOT from
an EMACS or ZWEI implementor necessarily).

I suggest that Help mention Undo explicitly, to help the naive user.
Perhaps Help U should do Undo.

On the other hand, I wish that Undo were by default on some single keystroke.

I wish that some single keystroke (on a Knight keyboard) would do C-X B Return.
This is a VERY common operation (I assert; has any thought been given to
collecting statistics on which ^R commands (expecially C-X ones) are invoked
most often, for possible redistribution to easier-to-reach keys?).
Also, the Stanford E editor has an extremely winning feature whereby all the
buffers (actually files) are ordered on a pdl, and C-H exchanges the top two
on the PDL (like C-X B), but C-M-H rotates the top k (default k=3), n C-H
rotates the top n, and n C-M-H rotates the top n and sets k to n.  This allows
easy running among three or more files.  Specifying a file explicitly is like
saying n C-H, where the file is n'th from the top of the pdl.  Perhaps
similar operations for the point/mark pdl and kill ring would also be useful.

I want to yell some more for C-M-O => C-O, and C-M-O = ^R Stack List Vertically.

I propose some commands which I believe would make LISP editing easier,
and I wish I had them right now:

(1) ^R Inject Arguments (suggested key: C-M->):
	n C-M->  means:   n C-M-F ) C-B n C-M-B ( Space C-B         [n positive]
			  n C-M-B ( Space n C-M-F ) C-M-P C-B C-B   [n negative]

    That is, take the following n s-expressions, wrap them up in a pair of
    parens, put a space after the left paren and the cursor before that.
    This prepares to make a new level of function call with the s-expressions
    as arguments.

(2) ^R Extract Arguments (suggested key: C-M-<):
        n C-M-<  means:   n C-M-F C-Space n C-M-B C-W C-( C-M-K C-Y
		except that the kill ring is not affected (but Undo can undo it).

    This takes n s-expressions and deletes the s-expression containing them,
    then puts them back in place of it.  Perhaps typing C-M-< after an n C-M-<
    should arrange to use the same n, i.e. allow incremental layers of list
    structure.  Maybe a zero argument should mean all s-expressions from
    point to the enclosing ).

(3) I think I've suggested these before:  LET Replace (LET Query Replace?),
    and LET Displace (LET Query Displace).
    LET Replace expects the cursor to be within a LET binding clause,
    and replaces all occurrences of the variable in the LET body with the
    corresponding expression.  Maybe if the cursor is in front of the set
    of bindings it does them all.
    LET Displace does the inverse operation.  It reads an expression
    and a variable, replaces occurrences of the expression with the
    variable in the body, then creates a new LET binding clause.

To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

Minor changes, mostly fixes and a few new variables to make things easier
for users with init and EVARS files.  Currently only on the ITS machines,
but soon to move to others.

1. A second C-X U (^R Unexpand Last Word) undoes the first one.

2. M-X Word Abbrev Mode without an argument will toggle the mode.

3. M-X Read Word Abbrev File can read in two kinds of definition file
formats: the default fast-loading kind, and the human-readable kind (the
one you see with M-X List Word Abbrevs).  M-X Write Word Abbrev File will
write human-readable format files if the Readable Word Abbrev Files option
variable is set to 1.

4. Setting the Only Global Abbrevs option variable to 1 will cause only
global abbrevs to be used.  Using only global abbrevs is faster, simpler
and some people find it more appropriate.

5. You can specify additional characters, e.g. the digits, that should
cause expansion.  See the description of the M-X Make These Characters
Expand command.  (Users with AI terminals: you can make Top-characters be
expanders too.)

*) New buffers will be created in Fundamental mode by default.
However, this behavior is controlled by the value of Default Major
Mode.  It can either be the name of the mode to create new buffers in
("Fundamental", "Text", etc.) or it can be the null string, meaning
create new buffers with the mode taken from the previous buffer.

*) View Directory displays an entire directory in the system standard
format.  It takes an arg which specifies which directory to display.

*) EMACS keeps better track of which buffers need saving and which
ones need auto saving.  A buffer will have a star if it needs a real
save, even if it has just had an auto save.  But even though it has a
star, EMACS will realize that another auto save is not necessary.

If you have an init file which is a compiled library,
and you find that in EMACS 143 your mode line is always

from a compiled init file of your own.

I will be away until Tuesday night, but perhaps MMCM will fix some
problems before then.

*) M-X What Page will say what page and line number the cursor is on.
What Cursor Position is the new name of ^R Where Am I, C-X =, which
says where on the screen the cursor is, and the value of point and
size of buffer.
   In completion, "W" is always a good abbreviation for "What".

*) The new View File command, which allows Backspace to move backwards
in the file, is installed.  Note that the reason View File does not
use a general recursive editing level is so as to avoid having to read
the entire file into core at any time.  This means it can start
displaying much faster, and it can be used on files which will not fit
in core.

*) M-Q is once again allowed in all major modes.

*) M-K kills to the end of the sentence.  It accepts repeat count
arguments, positive and negative.  C-X Rubout, ^R Backward Kill
Sentence, also accepts arguments.
All the sentence commands now observe all paragraph boundaries.
Blank lines and text justifier command lines are now considered
between paragraphs, not part of any paragraph.  M-] moves to the end
of the paragraph, not the beginning of the next.

*) C-K's arguments are now changed: -1 means kill to the previous
line-beginning (the beginning of the current line, unless point is
there, in which case it is the beginning of the previous line).  An
argument of 0 still means kill to the beginning of the current line.

*) C-X T is ^R Transpose Regions.  You mark both ends of one region,
and put point and mark around anothe region, and this transposes them.
Repeating the command undoes it.

*) CR when you are typing a function name (in M-X, etc) now performs
completion, internally, to prevent any paradoxical results from the
distribution of various function's definitions among multiple libraries.

*) M-^ no longer puts in a space when it joins a line onto a preceding
blank line.

*) "^R" will no longer appear in the mode line when you are inside a
recursive editing level.  Instead, just square brackets are used.

*) Indent Tabs Mode is now a variable you can set as well as a
function to toggle the setting.  -1 means use tabs, 0 means don't.

*) Overwrite Mode now leaves Meta commands unchanged.  It appeared
that the only people who liked having Overwrite Mode make Meta
characters insert were those who also use E at SAIL.  So it might make
sense for Stanford alone to change this back.


For customization only:

*) Init files are now executed entirely within ^R mode.  This should
eliminate some anomalous behavior observed from certain functions when
called from init files.

*) The command C-X ? can now be redefined just like any other C-X
command.

*) The prompt used by C-M-X is now obtained from the variable Instant
Command Prompt.

*) ^R Return to Superior will execute Return from Superior Hook, if it
exists, after EMACS is continued.

*) 2,M.L FOO makes FOO a permanent local variable in the current
buffer.  This means that FOO will not lose its local definition if you
switch major modes.  This is intended to be used by libraries to store
per-buffer internal information, not by the user, because making a
variable both a permanent local and a major mode local does not
attempt to do anything reasonable.

*) The name ^R Modified Two Windows has been changed to
^R Visit in Other Window.  This is the function on the C-X 4 command.

*) M.C can be used to give a variable a default value (set it only if
it does not already exist).

Most people prefer to have C-K changed.
However, an argument of zero will still mean to

Right now the C-K command is unlike the other killing and motion
commands in the way it understands zero and negative arguments.  Zero
means kill back to the start of the current line, killing nothing if
point is there already.  Minus one means kill back to the beginning of
the previous line.  This is simply inherited from the TECO K command.

If C-K were like the other commands, an argument of -1 would kill back
to the previous line-beginning, which could be the beginning of the
current line, or the beginning of the previous line if you were at the
beginning of a line.

To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
CC: DCB at MIT-MC
Something which I guess I should have mentioned in the info about TeX mode
is that in order to support flashing $...$'s, it is necessary to scan back
as far as the last pending { or beginning of file if at toplevel. This can
be very inefficient for long files and there is no way to get around it 
trivially from software. Hence, you may find it useful to add to your buffer
at points where you know there is a division that you would like the package
not to scan back past, the following character configuration:

	% {]

This will tell TeX mode not to scan back past this { in looking for other
$'s each time you type a $ ... It will not confuse the {...} balancing
commands except at the instant you type the ] ... and finally, it won't come
out in your output since % will comment it out. If this really causes people
problems and they find $'s are too slow or that for someother reason they
would like not to have it defaultly enabled, I'll create a variable you can
set to make TeX mode not turn on flashing $'s by default. -kmp

I like M-a and M-e except that they presently ignore negative args.  I
think like they ought to move in the opposite to normal direction to the
beginnings or ends of sentences respectively with negative args.  This
would provide a way to move to the beginning of the next sentence, i.e.
to the end of the current one and past the whitespace.  A function to
skip over contiguous whitespace is another way to make the same thing
possible with four keystrokes, (assuming a non-meta keyboard and the
skip-whitespace function on a meta or control-meta key.)

I think M-k should kill the current sentence with no arguments; kill
forward or backward with one positive or negative arg, kill a range from
arg1 beginnings of sentences back to arg2 ends of sentences forward with
two args.  Perhaps there ought to be killing of the space after or
before which would be applied uniformly by commands which kill words and
sentences and maybe larger units, but unless it were carefully worked
out, I prefer things the old familiar way they are now.

Sometime in the near future I will be installing a new version of the

1. To be compatible with the convention now used by other EMACS minor
modes, doing  MM Word Abbrev Mode$  (i.e. no explicit numeric argument)
will toggle the mode instead of turning it on.

2. The command MM Word Abbrev Apropos$filter$ will be going away, its
functionality replaced by MM List Word Abbrevs: the commands MM List
Word Abbrevs$ and MM Insert Word Abbrevs$ will take a filtering string
argument so that some abbrevs will be listed/inserted.  A null
argument will mean list/insert all the abbrevs, thus giving the old
behavior.

Thus to prepare for these changes, if you use these commands (say in
your init file), you can make the following replacements, which will
work now and after the change:

MM Word Abbrev Mode$            ->      1 MM Word Abbrev Mode$
MM List Word Abbrevs$           ->      MM List Word Abbrevs$$

there is a new View File command in the library VFILE on AI.
It can move backwards in the file as well as forwards.
Type Backspace to move back.
Its possible disadvantage is that it may be slower.
please try it and tell me what you think of it.
If people think it is a win, I'll make it the standard version.

It works by using random access IO to window part of the file
into a buffer, then windowing the buffer onto the screen.

MM Tabify will be changed so that just two spaces will never be
replaced with a tab.
It was suggested that this might be done only at ends of sentences,
but this would be extra difficulty, and could not eliminate problems
if there were any, but only make them happen less frequently.  It
doesn't appear that failure to insert a tab would be a problem,
anyway.

Should MM Tabify refrain from using tabs to replace just a pair of

Users of the MODLIN package may note that I have modified how the mode
line comes out ... lest ye be confused, please note -- 'DDT:' will no
longer appear when Emacs is a toplevel job. When it is running inferior
to another job (as in MAILT or LISPT) it will still try to say LISP:
or MAIL: as it always has. This change was made to conserve room for
the more useful data which some people have managed to run off the end

It would be really nice to have an emacs library which allowed one to
do spelling correction on the buffer, say, by invoking the spell
program or some other way.  In fact, it could be considerably more
useful than the current spell program if it also gave the user the
option of going into a recursive edit mode at the appropriate point in
the buffer in response to a spelling error.

Any benevolent hackers out there?

    I have a Visit File Hook which hides local modes info at the end of the
    file by setting the buffer bounds, and a command to toggle the buffer
    bounds so you can edit them if you want.  This has the advantage that
    M-> does not put you after the modes info, and if that info is hairy,
    it doesn't make your file look so kludgy while you are editing it.
    
    Now, for editing public files I think it might go along way towards
    lowering people's resistance to having this modes information in their
    files if this feature were made standard.

Let me point out that I think it would be an extremely bad idea to have
anything in the standard Emacs that hid anything in the file from the user.
This would only lead to difficulties and confusion when there was something
wrong with whatever it chose to hide, or when it decided to hide the wrong
thing.

This happened in the past when Teco (or Tecmac?) had a misfeature
by which it did not show extra control-C's at the end of a file.  A student
somehow got several hundred control-C's at the end of his thesis, which came
out as garbage characters when text-justified.  These control-C's could not
be removed or even seen with the editor (nor with the standard file-printing
command at the time, which had an even worse bug with control-C's).

I think a better approach would be to have a command that moved you to
just before the local modes, with the local modes just off the screen.
But please don't change m-> to do this!!

I have been receiving dozens of inquiries about why "TXJ no longer
works in the new EMACS".  In the old EMACS TXJ was autoloaded so
that simply typing M-X TXJ worked.  Now you have to type M-X LOAD LIB$TXJ
and then do M-X TXJ.  I don't know why RMS flushed this without
announcing it, but I am not surprised -- you will have to ask him.
Perhaps some general scheme would be desirable whereby a failing M-X
command would check for a library of the given name and try autoloading
it.  This would save a few characters for autoloading macro definitions
in the default EMACS.

What would you think of having C-\ as the standard exit command for
all recursive editing levels and subsystems, just as C-] is the
standard abort command?  C-\ would replace things like C-M-C (or
C-M-Z), Q, and C-Altmode.

Unfortunately, C-M-C (or C-M-Z) can't be used because it requires a
meta or control-meta prefix to type, and in subsystems there may be no
prefix characters.  C-Altmode has the same problem.  Thus limited to
ASCII characters, and ruling out printing ones and popular commands,
C-\ is the only choice.

It would still be imaginable to make C-M-C (or C-M-Z) the standard
exit command by making the control-meta prefix work in all subsystems,
but this would be painful to design in detail.

Subject:  New WORDAB release
To: INFO-EMACS-NEWS at MIT-AI

    A new version of the WORDAB (Word Abbrev Mode) library has been
installed.  This new version is a minor change from XWORDA library
which has been in use for quite a while among several users.  The old
version of the WORDAB library will be available for a while as OWORDA.
The major changes that uses of the old WORDAB library will see are:

    1. The format used for files of saved abbrev definitions is
different, less human readable but much faster to load.  For users
with old-style format files, the MM Read Word Abbrev File will
perform a conversion and rewrite the file in the new format.  (The old
file will be copied, just in case, to WORDAB ODEFNS on ITS,
WORDAB.ODEFNS.0 on Tenex/Twenex sites.)

    2. Multiple-line expansions are supported.

    3. MM Edit Word Abbrevs has a slightly different format, to allow
the more general expansions, e.g. multiple-line.  Basically, if you
have a double-quote character (") inside an expansion, it will be
doubled (""), to distinguish it from the double-quotes that surround
the entire expansion.

    4. There is a new command, MM Word Abbrev Apropos, that will list
some (not all) of the abbrevs currently defined.  Like MM Apropos,
it takes a string argument to match against the defined abbrevs:  any
abbrev containing that string, or having an expansion containing that
string, will be listed.

    5. Some commands went away, to leave a simpler looking user
interface.  These commands were:  MM Define Word Abbrevs, MM Insert
Word Abbrevs, MM Kill All Word Abbrevs, and MM Incremental Word
Abbrev Apropos.  If this bothers anyone, contact me.  (There are some
subroutine available to do the job, for instance.)

Subject: source compare

So many people have answered my query about source compare with
what I feel to be irrelevant answers that I fear that I have not
made myself clear enough.  I am very familiar with the various
"batch" source compares that exist (although I did learn about
some new ones too) and it is precisely because of that that I
sent my message.  One of the problems with a source compare like
that is you typically need to spread out your listings of the two
versions, along with your listing of the differences, and then
work hard to understand what really changed.  Just like a display
editor (like EMACS) is infinitely superior to a printing terminal
editor (tenex teco) because you can understand what's happening,
so would a "display" source compare that I envision.  The key
thing is that the files being compared would be VISIBLE and the
changes can be directly observed and compared.  The full power of
the editor could be used to walk around in the files to see what
is happening and possilby make some fixes.  I point out the
analogy to the compile feature mentioned in the multics emacs
paper that lets you, in the context of the editor, look at the
source file and error file in two windows and invoke a command to
move the cursor inthe source file buffer to the "next" error
mentioned in the error file.  this allows one to be freed from
the necessity to spread out those listings in the same way.

Come on, ladies and gents, let's raise our horizons somewhat!

Subject: source compare

Has anyone ever written a source compare function for EMACS?  It
seems like such an obvious thing, ie. have the two files to be
compared in two buffers and a user command to advance to the next

From: RMS at MIT-AI (Richard M. Stallman)
Subject: EMACS 141 changes
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

In EMACS 141, there will be these changes:

* Whether the parenthesis matching display feature beeps if there
is no matching parenthesis is controlled by the new variable
QPermit Unmatched Paren.  If it is 1, unmatched parens are permitted
(no beep) in all major modes.  If it is 0, they are never permitted
(always beep).  If it is -1, they are permitted except in Lisp mode
(because Lisp mode sets the variable to 0 if it was -1!).
The initial setting is -1.

Also, mismatched parens, as in "[)", will always beep if the matching
display feature is turned on.

* Help N prints out the file EMACS NEWS of EMACS change information.

* C-X = will now print out the total size of the file in characters
as well as its other information.  It should be self-explanatory.

* In M-X and C-M-X, just "I " as the start of a command will expand
automatically into "Insert ".  This is in addition to "V" for "View,
"L" for "List", "K" for Kill and "E" for Edit.  My intention is to
rename the commands that do one of these sorts of things to start with
the "standard" word for that type of operation, to make the command
names easier to remember.

* Get Date has been renamed to Insert Date.
Alter Options has been renamed to Edit Options.
Edit ..D has been renamed to Edit Syntax Table.
The first two of these changes are examples of the policy
described in the previous section.

* The function Auto Save Mode will no longer set the number
of versions to be kept or the number of characters between saves.
Its argument will only say whether to turn the mode on or off.
Those other parameters are the values of the variables
QAuto Save Max and QAuto Save Interval.  The first one already
existed; the second one is new.

* Write File and Set Visited Filename now run the Visit File Hook,
if there is one, but give it an argument of 1 to distinguish themselves
from an actual Visit File.


Also, these changes have been made in other libraries:

In KBDMAC, there is now C-U C-X Q.  It causes a recursive editing level
to be entered when the macro is defined and again when the macro is run.
Thus, at that point in the macro, you can do a different thing each time
around.

In PAGE, there are several changes:

* ^R Go to Page is now ^R Goto Page, so as to resemble the other commands,
and lives by default on C-X C-P instead of on M-G.  M-G and C-M-G are
no longer changed by the package.

* C-X C-P when you are looking at the whole buffer
will now narrow to just the page that point is in.

* Print File Directory has been renamed to View Page Directory.
(After all, a file directory is something entirely else).
Make File Directory has been renamed to Insert Page Directory.

* Trying to move to a nonexistent page will get an error, but
will leave you in the first or last page with the correct page
number in the mode line.

By "read only" I mean that it would be impossible to modify the buffer.
I suppose that an alternative might be that M-X Save All Files would
not offer to save the buffer and C-X C-S would ask for confirmation
before saving it.  Sorry for not having explained this before.
In fact, I'm sorry I asked, because all I found out is that nobody
understands how things work now.  Most of the reasons people gave
for doing things the way they do are based on factual errors about
how things work.  So the main need seems to be to stop having C-X C-R
and C-X C-V as nearly identical commands so that people will not be:
confused about the difference.

It seems some people don't know what C-X C-V is and how it differs
from C-X C-R, and therefore don't understand what the actual consequences
of making C-X C-R mean "read only" would be.

Right now C-X C-V and C-X C-R are identical except that when you visit a file
with C-X C-V, change it, and then visit another file in that buffer,
EMACS will offer to save the original file.  If you had visited the
original file with C-X C-R, EMACS would not offer to save the changes.
Aside from an effect on auto saving, this is the ONLY difference.
When a file is visited in a separate buffer with C-X C-F, it does a
C-X C-V type of visit rather than a C-X C-R type of visit, unless you
change a flag (Find File Inhibit Write).

C-M-X (^R Instant Extended Command) won't actually start

RMS@AI  Here is what has changed in version 139 since version 135:
* Tab Stop Definitions works differently now.
The value of this variable is now just a string, not a buffer,
so you can set it more easily in an init file or with a local modes list.
Also, the two lines it is supposed to contain have been interchanged.
This means that now it is the second line which can usually just be blank.
When that happens, you are allowed to omit the CRLFs, which is an
additional convenience in setting the variable.
You can still set it with Edit Tab Stops.

* C-X C-T now runs ^R Exchange Lines.

* The variable Lisp ) Hack has been renamed to Display Matching Paren.
It is now -1 by default.  Text and TECO modes turn it off locally, but
you can have a Text Mode Hook or TECO Mode Hook to turn it back on if
you like.  Whenever the feature is on, it will now apply automatically
to all characters which have the syntax of ")" in ..D.  This uses the
new FS ^R PAREN feature of TECO.

* There is now a new standard way to get out of subsystems and
recursive editing modes: the character C-].  All recursive editing
modes (except minibuffers) will automatically support C-], and all
subsystems ought to support C-].  For example, C-] while editing a
message to send will exit and not send the message.  If there is some
way to resume the command you aborted, C-] will tell you.  For
example, after aborting a message, it will tell you how to resume
editing it so that you do not lose what you had typed in.

* The new Undo command will undo many sorts of gross changes to the
buffer.  You do not have to give it immediately after the change
occurs.  However, only the last gross change can be undone in this
way.  Not all changes can be undone.  However, Undo always tells you
what sort of change it plans to undo, and asks for confirmation.
Also, Undo can be undone by a second Undo, so it is safe to try it out.

* The C-X C-E command has been deleted.  To get auto-save to save as
the visited filename, set QAuto Save Visited File nonzero and use
C-X C-V.  A zero setting of QInhibit Write now means that C-X C-V
was used.

* Auto save can now be used when you are not visiting any file, but it
will never be on by default at such times.  You must use M-X Auto Save
to turn it on.  If you do C-X C-S when you are not visiting a file, it
will ask you for filenames to save under.

* Using Rubout or C-D with an argument now saves on the kill ring.

* A CRLF will now appear to be a single character when you move over
it with C-F or C-B.

* M-K is now ^R Kill Sentence.  It kills the sentence containing
point, or the one following point if point is between sentences.

* C-M-X is now an alternative version of M-X which does not read any
arguments for the command itself.  As soon as you terminate the
command name the command is executed, and it reads its own arguments.
This has the advantage that any special processing on these arguments
(if they are command names or filenames) can take place.  It has two
disadvantages: you can't rub out from the arguments back into the
command name, and the command is not saved in the ring buffer of
commands for access with C-X Altmode.

* EVARS files are now better documented, and allow you to specify C-X
subcommands and to include comment lines.

* The mode line will no longer contain the name of the selected buffer
when that is the same as the first filename of the file you are
visiting.

* When you ask for the documentation of a command, and it tells you
about another command, it will tell you what that command is in your
current environment, rather than what it is in the standard
environment.  For example, when M-Q tells you about the ^R Set Fill
Column command, it will normally say "C-X F", but if you move that
command elsewhere it will say wherever it actually is.

* The SORT library contains commands for sorting the region line by
line, paragraph by paragraph, or page by page.
The BCPL library implements BCPL mode.  The BLSLIB library implements
BLISS mode.  Unfortunately, there is no documentation for either of
those modes outside of their self-documentation.

* The Apropos command will omit mention of subroutines if you give it
a numeric argument.  Help A invokes it this way.  This is to avoid
confusing new users with them.

* ^R Just One Space is now available but not on any key by default.
It is like the M-\ command but leaves one space (or how ever many the
argument is).

* The commands Make Local Q-register and Kill Local Q-register now
allow you to make TECO FS flags local.  To make the flag FS CTLMTA
local, just specify "FS CTLMTA" as the "q-register name" argument.

* You can now set any variable conveniently with the Set Variable
command, and put commands on characters conveniently with the Set Key
command.

* C-M-V with just a minus sign as argument scrolls the other window a
full screen backwards.

* M-X Revert File now asks for confirmation.

* Commands M-X Delete File, M-X Copy File and M-X Rename File now
exist for performing those operations.  They take one or two string
arguments, as in M-X Copy File<from><to><cr>.  These should not be
needed in TECO code since the ED, E_ and EN commands exist.

Changed Names and Eliminated Commands

* The commands ^R Set Column, ^R End Comment, ^R MM Via Mini and
^R Mini Visited File have been flushed.

* The commands Make Variable, Set Variable Comment, Make Dispatch
String and Make Prefix Character now have "&" in front of their names.
All commands names which used to start with "^^" now start with "&"
instead.  & Macro Get Full Name is now called & Macro Name.

* The command List One File has been flushed.  List Library can now be
used to list the contents of libraries already loaded as well as
libraries not loaded.  The command Variable Apropos has been flushed.
The command List Variables now takes a string argument which is a
substring to match on.  If the argument is null, all variables are
listed.  Thus, List Variables can be used for either purpose.

* The commands RMAIL and ^R RMAIL have been flushed in favor of the
Read Mail command, which uses a variable to decide which library to
use for reading the mail.

* ^R Execute Completed MM Command has been renamed ^R Extended
Command, but the old name has been kept around for the sake of
libraries which refer to it.

Several people have asked mewhy we needed C-] when we have C-Altmode
(or, C-C C-C).  What I propose for C-] to do is not the same as C-Altmode.
C-Altmode returns from a recursive edit.
C-] will quit the command containing the recursive edit.
Thus, C-Altmode while editing a message would send it,
but C-] would not send it.
The same is true of what C-G would do instead of C-]
if the second alternative is preferred to the first.

The issue is, is it better to enable novices to get out of all unusual states
by repeated use of C-G, or is it better to make it more reliable
to choose between quitting a partly typed or running command
and quitting a recursive editing mode.

Date: 14 OCT 1979 1112-EDT
From: RMS at MIT-AI (Richard M. Stallman)
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

I'm considering two possible plans for making quitting out of
recursive editing levels more standardized.
One is that ^G will always only quit as far as the innermost
recursive edit, and ^] will quit out of one recursive edit
up to the next edit level.  ^G will still flush partially typed
and running commands, whereas ^] will be an ordinary command
that can't be used in the middle of a command.  It will ask
for confirmation before quitting.

The other plan is that ^G serves both functions.  When there is a partially
typed or running command, or an argument, it will just flush that.
Otherwise, inside a recursive edit, it will ask whether to quit one
level up and then maybe do so.  If you try to quit while it is asking
that question, it could interpret that as "yes" (I'm not sure whether
this is a good idea).

Please tell me as much as you can about what you think of these plans
and why.

I am thinking of getting rid of the C-X C-E command.

Right now, there are these differences between C-X C-E and C-X C-V:

If you visit a file with C-X C-E, and then visit another file
on top of it, the old file is saved automatically.  If it was
visited with C-X C-V, you are asked whether to save it.
If you visit a file with C-X C-E, and use auto save, the auto saves
go under the same name you visited.  If you use C-X C-V, then auto saves
go under the "auto save" filenames.

I propose to eliminate the C-X C-E command, leaving C-X C-v the same,
and add a flag that could be use to get the old C-X C-E type of autosaving
while using C-X C-V.

Opinions?

Do you think that commands like Auto Fill Mode, Overwrite Mode, etc.
should toggle the modes if given no argument
instead of turning them on with no argument?
Explicit arguments of 1 would still turn them on
and 0 or - would turn them off.
This might be especially useful for putting them on keys.

I have put a simple library of PHRASE macros (meant to be analogous to

Loading PHRASE gives you

    ^R Mark Phrase     -- on Control-Meta-comma
    ^R Delete Phrase   -- on Control-X comma

A phrase is taken to be text plus the following punctuation.  They all do
sensible things with arguments.  The search string defining a phrase

some suggested minor changes:

(1) when a file is opened with ^X^R and auto saving is on,
typing ^X^C should NOT write out the file automatically.
Rather, EMACS should ask "write out changes in file ..."

(2) when a file is opened with ^X^E the mode line should
contain an (ED), just as it now contains a (RO) for  ^X^R.

This information may not be of interest to all of those who
this was mailed to, but I feel someone might have some
answers.
I have tried using emacs thru crtsty and :tctyp with the t1061
and dm2500, over the network. problems i have encountered with
these terminals are as follows:

datamedia 2500 when thru :tctyp (assuming a direct network
dial-up thru a tip)
echo random alpha characters
when inserting text with emacs. it apears some escape sequence
of sorts is being sent, to possistion the cursor, however
it loses, as if it is being repeated (uneccasryily).

this is the only problem i have encountered (i was using both :tctyp dm
and :tctyp datamedia setting )

This makes me belive that the lossage is from emacs rather than
:tctyp however, I don't know enough about either to
know if this is correct.


Te;Teleray 1061:

When supduping or telenetting from a foreign site,
emacs doesn't display properly the control characters,
they are not represented byt ^a ^h  etc but seem to be echoed
as the ascii value and this is quite confusing (as they are
therefore not visable on the screen)

I don't know the cause for this crock if it is telnet or supdup
or what.

I hope this information has been o value and if any one knows the answers
or can possibly explain this.. I would appreciate an answer

thanks,

I use a slightly different tack.  I, too, have a binding for M-<Space>
which (by default) leaves one space at the cursor.  However, given an
argument, it leaves ARG number of spaces.  Thus, at the end of a
sentence, I often say M-2 M-<Space>, and I very seldom use M-\ as I find
M-0 M-<Space> to be far more mnemonic.

how about having C-x C-o remove all vertical blank lines instead of leaving one
if there were more than one to start (a feature that I sometimes find very annoying), 
and create a new command, perhaps C-x C-space, that would always make there be
exactly one blank line.

Tenex and Twenex people:
would it be a good idea for C-X C-S and Save All Files

The effect of this is that if you visit a file specifying

copied a middle-aged version to EMACS;OUTLIN :EJ and the source
to EMACS1;OUTLIN > for those who want to try it out.  Get

I am not currently working on this macro package, so please

I) Has anyone considered (or is there hiding somewhere) an EMACS submode
    for outline writing?  
   A) It would know about  
      1) Outline levels (I am on level I.A)
      2) Entry numbers (I am on entry number I.A.1)
   A) Commands might be:
      1) Increment Outline Level
         a) Sets outline down one level
         b) Chooses the correct character string from the
             heading string and sets the left margin so
             auto-fill does the right thing
      2) Decrement Outline Level
         a) Sets outline up one level
         b) As above
      3) Start Outline Entry
         a) Outputs the string which preceeds an entry, in
             this case '       a) '
         b) Invoked by tab?
      4) Set Heading String, sets a variable which provides
	  an appropriate string for each level.
      5) Set Indent Increment, sets a variable which decides
          how far to increment the indent on each change in
          outline level
      6) Insert New Entry, does a Start Outline Entry, but
          relabels all the entries on the current level by
	  incrementing them so that the new entry can be inserted.

   B) That's the rough idea.  Any comments?

This version is not going to be installed on ML, MC or DM.
There are significant changes:
*) The self documentation features now know about names for the
built-in TECO ^R command definitions.  For example, Apropos of "Line"
will now show ^R Open Line on C-O.  You can't actually call those
commands by those names, unless you load the library BARE;  this
library is temporarily loaded by the documentation commands that need
it.  MM& Load BARE loads BARE and causes BARE to remain loaded until
its caller returns.

*) C-U C-Y differs from plain C-Y in that it leaves point before
the un-killed text and the mark after.

*) C-U C-L causes the line point is on to be redisplayed.
Actual numeric arguments (not just C-U) still specify
a line to display point on.

*) C-; and M-; (^R Indent for Comment) now inserts the comment
terminator as well as the comment starter, leaving point in between
them.  M-N and M-P (^R Down Comment Line, and .. Up ..), have been
modified for this behavior.

*) M-G and M-Q (^R Fill Paragraph and ^R Fill Region) now by default
remove excess spaces such as are produced by filling.

*) Return now will not gobble a blank line followed by a nonblank
line.

*) C-K will now treat a blank line as if it were empty, killing
through the CRLF instead of to it.  More specifically, if point is
followed by a CRLF with only whitespace in between, C-K will kill
through the CRLF.

*) M-[ and M-] (^R Backward Paragraph, and ... Forward ...), now treat
"\" at the front of a line just like "." and "-", for the sake of TEX
files.  This special treatment is that if those characters are
declared (using QParagraph Delimiter) to start paragraphs, then
whenever a paragraph starts for that reason, that paragraph is only
one line long.

*) You can now put MM Query Replace on a character.  It will read its
arguments in the echo area.

*) Errors in auto-saving will type out "(Auto Save Error!)".

*) ^R Indent Nested (the definition of Tab in certain modes) now does
something useful with negative arguments.  It indents the line more
than the previous line, (* (ABS ARGUMENT) (MAX 1 QIndent Increment))
spaces more.  QIndent Increment is not initially defined.

*) There is now an autoloading definition for C-X ( which loads in
KBDMAC and transfers to it.  People need no longer load KBDMAC in
their init files.  You will now see "Def" in the mode line while
defining a keyboard macro.

*) Exiting from the top-level ^R invocation now returns to EMACS's
superior.  To exit from it back to TECO command level, do
1MM Top Level.  This will advise you to re-enter ^R mode by doing
:M..L.  Returning to the superior will now clear out the mode line
completely.

*) Creating a new buffer initializes it in the same mode as the
previous selected buffer.  This uses the new @F^G command in TECO.

*) Making variables like QAuto Fill Mode local now works
straightforwardly;  it is no longer necessary to deal with the crock
Switch Modes Process Options, which no longer exists.  These variables
have been equipped with macros which are run whenever their values
change.  Thus, simply doing 1UAuto Fill Mode is enough to turn on
the mode.  MM & Process Options no longer exists.  A side effect of
this is that buffer switching is much faster.  This uses the new
FS VAR MACRO feature of TECO.  QProcess Options Hook no longer
exists; instead, you must make macros to be run when your variables'
values change.  This will be documented in CONV later.

*) Instead of calling MM & Set Mode Line, macros should simply do
1FS Mode Change, which will cause MM & Set Mode Line to be called
when the mode line comes up for redisplay.  Thus, multiple reasons for
calling it will not cause it to be called more than once.
QSet Mode Line Hook still exists and works as before.

When you answer my question about the CR command,
please say whether your usual terminals have insert/delete line
and whether you think that has anything to do with your decision.
I would like to determine whether this is a matter of different types

Also, do you think that M-Q should by default flush excess spaces?
This would be a little slower, and might sometimes do the wrong thing

What do you think of these changes, suggested by EAK:
1) C-K would not consider blanks when deciding whether
it was at the end of a line.  In other words, C-K when point
was followed by blanks and a CRLF would kill through thr CRLF.

2) CR would not gobble up a blank line followed by a nonblank one.
In other words, typing text with CR's at the end of a paragraph
would not use up the blank line separating it from the next paragraph.

I can imagine that 2) might bother people who on terminals without
insert/delete line are used to inserting several lines of text by
first making the lines with C-O and then filling in the text.
Do people actually use that technique?

To:   info-emacs at AI

The go to next and go to previous page commands have been moved to C-X ]
and C-X [, respectively.  These commands were previously page handling
commands but are now replaced by the commands from the page library.
Also, if you like ^R String Search instead of the default Incremental
Search, the PAGE library remembers that.  If you use some other search,
or you put your search on a character other than C-S or M-S, then you
will get a message saying that PAGE cannot find your search.  In that
case, you must do M.M^R My Search$ M.VReal Search Macro$ for the PAGE
search to work right.  Then you can put ^R PAGE search$ and ^R PAGE
Reverse Search$ on whatever characters you want.

Also, if ^R PAGE Search is given a precomma arg, it macros that
instead of Q$Real Search Macro$.  Thus, other macros can use this
facility to do things to the whole buffer, closing the bounds when finished.

    The documentation for Text mode states that there are no comments.
    This is good.  However, a new user types M-N and gets immediately
    very confused.  Why doesn't MMText Mode disable comment commands???

My philosophy on text mode was that nothing should automatically
recognize any comments, but that commands that are specifically for
comments, such as M-;, C-M-; and M-N, might as well still do what the
user asked.
I am willing to change this if there is a real concensus.
Do you ever use those commands in Text mode?

MOON@MIT-MC 02/10/79 18:03:38 Re: Meta-G (CWH)
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
I must point that Carl is confused.  EINE's actual scheme is to keep
track of whether the region is "really" there, and to display it with
underlining or inverse video when it is "actually there".  This is hard
for Emacs to do, as it depends on keeping the mark (the region) and the
point-pdl (old places you may want to go back to) separately.  Emacs
does ask you before saving the region on meta-G and similar commands,
if the region is very large (a certain number of characters, I forget
exactly how many.) 

CWH@MIT-MC 02/10/79 17:46:40 Re: Meta-G
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC, MOON at MIT-MC
I don't think the problem is so much the current binding of Meta-G to
Fill Region, as in unintentionally keeping a large region around for
a long period of time.  I think that we should adopt EINE's scheme
whereby the mark follows the point whenever a self-inserting charater
is typed (or perhaps a non-cursor-moving character -- I'm not exactly
sure what the mechanism is).  This will not only solve the Meta-G problem,
but will keep naive users from losing so much from Control-W and other
commands which affect the region.


MOON@MIT-MC 02/09/79 02:38:59 Re: Meta-G
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
It has been pointed out that typing meta-G accidentally can screw you.  This is
true, however the old text is saved on the kill-ring, and you can get it back
with control-Y.  MMcM and I just fixed a bug so that you can type meta-Y immediately
after a meta-G, and the command will be fully un-done.  This fix is in the Emacs
source code but is not yet installed.  This also applies to control-X control-L
and control-X control-U (lower and upper case region).

If anyone has opinions about whether this makes the meta-G command
livable-with on its present key, or not, mail them to BUG-EMACS.

How about if Select Buffer, in two-window mode,

To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI
I have flushed the TEMACS macro library.  Instead there are now the libraries:
SCRLIN - macros for moving over screen lines instead of text lines.
         Automatically sets up ^A, ^E, ^N, ^P.  On non-display consoles,
         these macros revert to text line movers.
DELIM  - macros for moving over balanced pairs of []{}()<>"'.
         Sets up C-[, C-], C-(, C-), etc. to move over pairs (forward or back).
JLKMAC - Mostly defines setup hooks for JLK.

Anybody currently using TEMACS probably wants to simply load SCRLIN or DELIM.
Other people who wanted to try out screen line moving or delimiter moving,
but didn't want to get screwed by JLK's hacks, now have a chance.


OTA@MIT-MC 01/16/79 05:09:01 Re: auto save mode
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
It seems like the major problem with auto save mode where output
is going to the regular filename is that it sometimes deletes
files it didn't output.  Couldn't is just keep around the version
numbers of all the files it wrote out by itself.  This should not
include ^X^S files.  Then it would leave files that were ^X^Sed,
or otherwise written out, behind as the auto saved  version
numbers increased.  It would only have to keep 2 or 3 numbers
around.  If this really worked there would be no reason to keep
around lots and lots of them.  You could ocasionally ^X^S when
you get to a good spot and those would stay around.  It seems to
me that this is essentially equivalant to the separate filename
mode but much handier.

EMACS 129 is now NE.
There is a new command ^X4 which enters two window mode

Follow the ^X4 with B and a buffer name, F or ^F and a file name,
or T or . and a tag name.

Meta-' (^R Upcase Digit) now works on all keyboards.
The first time you use it, it asks you to type the digits
1, 2, ... 9, 0 holding down the shift key so it can tell
what your keyboard looks like.  For then on it works automatically.
If you don't recall, this command finds the last digit
on the current or previous line and shifts the character.
It is for when you forget to use the shift key.

A special interest group does exist for people who use

So the argument belongs quite rightly in INFO-EMACS.  For
strictly low baud rate and non-controversial EMACS options,
however, do use INFO-300.

To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-MC
The SLOWLY library is shortly going to have exactly what JLS was looking for.
I.e ^R Narrow Display which will take an argument to say how much of the
screen to use.  A negative argument will mean to use the bottom of the screen
instead of the top.

Also, SLOWLY has ^R Slow Incremental Search, which uses a narrowed part of
the screen for the search (say, a single line, or a couple lines) for it's
redisplay of what's been found so far, and then displays the rest of the
context when the search is exited.

It will also have a version of & Minibuffer which uses the bottom or
the top of the screen as you wish.  So you can use the top of your
screen for editing, and the bottom part of your screen for minibuffers.

Since I'm trying to get this stuff ready to go with the tapes RMS is going to
take with him to the West Coast, I'm going to need volunteers to test this
stuff thouroughly before then, on both ITS and TWENEX.  If you use slow

If  you type an abbrev all in caps, e.g. "FOO", and it expands to more
than one word, e.g. "find outer otter", then the default is the old
action:  just capitalize each word, e.g. "Find Outer Otter".  However,
if the variable WORDAB All Caps is non-zero, the entire expansion is
upper-cased, e.g. "FIND OUTER OTTER", which may be much more convenient
for those editing all-uppercase code for instance.

Subject: ^X2
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

  I think everything about ^X2 currently is slightly wedged.  For the
record, I liked NEITHER the old nor the new schemes.  What I
really want is some way of specifying, when I ask for two-window
mode, which buffer I want in the second window.  In other words
it should also be a buffer select and ask for a buffer name;
a simple <CR> would default the name to whatever the new scheme
uses (i.e. depending on ^U argument).  Thus to initially effect the current
"new" scheme, one types C-X 2 CR; for the old, C-X 2 W 2 CR (to get/create
buffer W2).
   My primary reason for this is that over the network or on a slow
speed terminal it is agony to watch EMACS re-display something that you
don't want, which is often; being able to arbitrarily select the buffer
before display starts will avoid this.  I've tried both the old and new
schemes, and get screwed by both of them (more by the new than the old,
even); the change I propose seems very cheap and simple and flexible,
and avoids the screwage problems I have.  Do other people see any
problems in it? (I don't see the extra <CR> character as a problem).

Thank you for your replies.  People are overwhelmingly
in favor of the change.  However, non-MIT people are
mostly opposed.  I have a few more questions:

1) Do you normally use ^X^F to visit files, or do you
normally visit a new file in the same buffer?

2) Do you set the value of Tags Find File to 1 in your init?

3) Did you like the change?
(so I don't have to match up your new answers with your old answers).

4a) If you liked the change, did you know about the ^U^X2 command?

4b) If you did not like the change, do you know that ^X2 and
^U^X2 are NOT now identical, except for the first time you enter
two-window mode?  Do you know about the ^XB command for switching
buffers?

In case you don't know, ^X2 puts you into two window mode showing
in window two whatever buffer was in it the last time; showing the
same buffer as in window one, if there was no last time.
^U^X2 puts you into two window mode and always shows in window two
the same buffer that was in window one when the command was given.

5) Now that you know that, what is your opinion of the change?

1) ^X[ and ^X], new, move to the previous and next page boundary.
^X^P will now always mark the page that point is in.

2) Query Replace and Replace String, when Case Replace is set,
will now preserve case only if the string to be replaced
contains no upper-case letters.  Thus, you can use Query Replace
to change something to lower case without turning off Case Replace.
You can also use it to convert something to upper case, since
the case-preservation works by upcasing only.  Anything you specify
as upper case in the string to replace with will always go in
as upper case.

3) Meta-' is now ^R Upcase Digit, which finds the last 7, 8 or 9
on the current line before point, or the previous line, and
replaces it with a ', ( or ).

Use ^X( to start defining a keyboard macro, and ^X) to end the definition.
^XE executes the last keyboard macro defined.  An argument serves
as a repeat count.
To save a keyboard macro for a longer time, use MM Name Kbd Macro.
It takes as a string argument the name to use for an MM command to define
to run the macro, and reads from the terminal a ^R command to define.
Type Return or Rubout if you don't want to define a ^R command.
Use a null string argument if you don't want to define an MM command
(though you should always define one, even if your intended use is
as via the ^R command).

View Kbd Macro will print out the contents of a keyboard macro,
reading the ^R command from the terminal.  You can give ^XE as
the ^R command to view the last macro defined.

^X commands can be used as the ^R commands to put macros on.
However, you aren't allowed to clobber any already defined command
this way, unless the definition is another keyboard macro or
similar thing.

Subject: New command Compile for compiling your program.
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

MM Compile will compile the program you are editing.
Unless given a numeric argument, it first offers to write
out any files that have been changed.
Then it compiled the visited file in whatever way is appropriate
for the major mode you are in.  This method of compilation can
be overridden by setting the variable Compile Command to a TECO
command string to perform the compilation.  It can expect the
name of the visited file to be in Q1 and in the default file names.
Most compilation methods will involve valretting commands to DDT.
They normally leave you in DDT so you can load up or test the program.

A string argument to MM Compile is stuck into the compilation command
so as to be useful for specifying extra switches or an output file.
Thus, in a MIDAS program, MM Compile/T would give MIDAS the /T
switch, and MM CompileFOO;_ would put FOO;_ at the front of the
command string, thus putting the binary on FOO;.  User-supplied
compilation methods can't be vouched for, but ought to try to do this.

MM Compile is available only in NE, as yet.
It will not self-document properly until the next EMACS version.

1) You can now have local character redefintions in files.
They look almost like ordinary local modes,
except that you use the name of tha character (such as, "...^RD")
as the variable name, and some TECO code to come up with the 
value instead of a literal string.  For example, this
;Local Modes:
;Mode:MIDAS
;...D: M.M ^R Down List
;End:
willset up a mode like MIDAS mode except that C-M-D retains
its normal definition instead of MIDAS mode's redefinition
(This mode is good for editing Lisp machine microcode).

2) Dump Environment has been greatly improved by EAK.
The documentation in CONV has not been updated yet, but
its self-documentation is informative.

Subject: Changes to ^V, string-search
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

In the next Emacs, the following changes will exist.

If you define the variable Next Screen Context Lines, it will be the
number of lines of overlap used by c-V (^R Next Screen) and m-V (^R
Previous Screen).  The default remains 2.

In Character Search and String Search (note that these are different
from the default search, Incremental Search), the ^F feature now
will put the cursor Next Screen Context Lines down from the top
instead of at the very top.  If you don't like this, complain
and I'll flush it.

String Search now obeys its numeric argument (a long-standing bug fix).

String Search has two new features inspired by Multics Emacs.  Typing
^Y will yank in the default without flushing what you've already typed.
Compare this with ^D.  Typing ^W will put you in word-search mode, in
which the words you type will be found regardless of what punctuation
and white-space characters lie between them.  meta-F's definition of
"word" is used, thus Atom Word Mode applies, but in Text Mode punctuation
is considered part of the adjacent word.  Currently word-search
only finds exact matches, (e.g. searching for "to and fro" doesn't find
"grotto and frobs").  If anyone thinks it should be the other way, I can
change it.

    The WORDAB and XWORDA libraries now have a new command, which was
suggested by KMP: ^R Inverse Add Mode Word Abbrev, which is put on ^X -
(previously unused in the default EMACS environment).  I think people will
find this a very useful command to complement ^X^A.

    This command has an opposite sense from ^X^A (^R Add Mode Word
Abbrev), namely: you define an expansion for the word before point.  (For
instance: you thought you had an abbrev "foo", but "foo" didn't expand.
So you type ^X -, "Find Outer Otter", return, and thus define the abbrev
"foo".)  You can give ^X - a numeric argument, which means the abbrev to
be defined is n words back.  ^X - will end by expanding the abbrev.

The library NCASE contains the experimental word case conversion
commands, and puts them on M-L, M-C, and M-U unless
you supply an NCASE Setup Hook.
They apply to the previous word when the last character typed

In addition, when given in the middle of a word, they apply
to the whole word.
Please take the trouble to try them out.  If you try them
long enough to get used to them, I'll be interested in hearing
how each of those two changes affects their convenience of use.

Subject: Answering questions about changing EMACS.
To: INFO-EMACS at MIT-AI

When I ask for people's opinions on a possible change to EMACS,
I don't just want to get a "yes" or a "no".  Such answers don't
really help me.  I don't regard the answers as votes, and I don't
just count the "yes" and "no" answers.  What I am looking for
by asking these questions is an idea of which segments of the
user community will be helped and which will be hurt.  I want
to know what it is about a user that determines what his
opinion will be.  For this, I need more information in answers.

In addition, a lot of people just say "Don't change it.  I don't
think anything should ever be changed".  Such a statement does
not address the question I have asked, which is whether the changed
command would be better than the existing one.  Since I have already
decided that it is better to make improvements than never change
anything, such statements are wasted breath.

Some replies to my latest question (about case-conversion commands)
which did supply some information are those which say "Don't change them.
Typing M-B is easy enough".  These replies generally come from
people who use Meta-keyboards, and it is logical that they should
have that opinion.  A few came from people whose keyboard usage
I do not know, but would like to find out, since how easy
people on non-Meta keyboards regard the typing of M-B is
clearly the center of the issue.

I will probably make the changed case commands available
in a library for people to try out.

The current way that the word case conversion commands (M-C, M-L,
M-U) work is good for converting a lot of upper case to mixed cases,
but isn't so good for when you have just typed a word in the
wrong case.  At such a time, it would be better for the case
conversion commands to apply to the previous word instead of
the next one.

What would you think of making these commands apply to the
previous word if and only if the last character typed was a
printing character (including Space)?

I realize that this introduces a measure of unpredictability,
but only very little, since it almost always does the right thing.
Use with numeric arguments will be unchanged, of course.

People have in the past investigated compromises in which
the commands would act differently at the front of a word and at
the back of a word, but such schemes all do the wrong thing
frequently.

The SLOWLY library is a library (maintained by me, more or less) for

is to use only one line, but it may be changed by giving Q$Slow Search Lines Used$ a value other than 1 (use M.V to create it).

Some people have suggested that ^X2 ask for a buffer name
only the first time it is used.  I think that this is a bad
idea.  When a user starts to use two window mode for a given
purpose, he may or may not have been using it for another
purpose earlier in the same EMACS.  Whatever the user wants
^X2 to do then, it must be independent of whether such prior
use had taken place.  But this suggestion would make ^X2's
behavior depend on that, so it must be wrong.

Also, this is the sort of question which you would want to
type ahead the answer to;  but often you would be surprised
to find that ^X2 had been used before and the question was
not asked.

So, if ^X2 is going to ask a question, it should always ask it.

Tabular Text Mode and Indented Text Mode are now gone as

They are the first examples of "submodes", which are
commands that call ^R recursively on the buffer
with auto-saving still turned on.  When you are inside
a submode, the name of the submode appears inside square-brackets
after the name of the major mode.

A few commands concerning q-registers, which were not in the default
enviroment but used by TECMAC, have been deleted.

The library purifier now no longer converts uparrow-L to
a control-L.  You were already told to change the uparrow-L's
to control-L's, with preceding ^]^Q's when they were at the
beginnings of lines.

*** If you have a start-up library instead of just an init file,
you can now call that library the same thing you would call the

something after the word you want to abbreviate.

For the times when you want to include break characters before or

If your init file sets any variable whose effect is to redefine
some command character, you must run MM & Process Options
to make the setting take effect.  This was always true, but in the
past visiting a file or switching buffers would do it for you.
Now, to save time, they call & Process Options only when they think it
is necessary, so you must do it yourself when you make it necessary.

These are the variables in question;

Atom Word Mode
Auto Fill Mode
Autoarg Mode
FS CTLMTA
Lisp ) Hack
Overwrite Mode

It will not work to put any of these variables in a file's local modes
unless you also put in "Switch Modes Process Options:1".  However,
these variables all relate to a user's taste in editing, rather than to
the contents of a file, so they belong in your init file rather than
in the local modes (imagine that someone else looks at the file;  does
he want Atom Word Mode set?).  Fill Column is an example of something
that does belong in the Local Modes;  it specifies how the file should
look, rather than just how certain commands should be changed.

By the way, there has not been any connection between Lisp ) Hack

be possible to reuse "X".  Does that sound like a good idea?

NWORDA and XWORDA versions of Word Abbrev Mode (only runnable in NE) are
allow much faster buffer- and mode-switching now.  Also, there is a
new, special kind of abbrev expander for Tab which should help LISP and
TECO users who have had trouble:  it won't expand if Tab is not inserting
space at point.

Did anyone use the $Untouched by Word Abbrev$ or $Word Abbrev Hook$
variables?  If so, please contact me.
