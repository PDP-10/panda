!~FILENAME~:! !Commands to use Heath keypad!
TEKHEATH

!& Setup TEKHEATH Library:! !S Sets up heath keypad.
Makes the obvious assignments to the arrows, less obvious
ones to everything else.  ESC becomes a prefix character,
with dispatch in .Y; ESC ? becomes another prefix character,
with dispatch in .Z.  Q.P gets a modified Prefix driver to
make this all work.  If $TEKHEATH Setup Hook$ is defined, it is run
afterwards to make any additional assignments or changes; it can
access the function Set Heath Key (q.v.) by running MS, e.g.

!& Heath Prefix Character Driver:! !S M.P for Heath: handles prefix character.
Given a q-vector as argument, it reads a character
and returns the q-vector element it selects.
Difference between this and standard is that ? is not treated as help.
The character read is left in Q..1.!

!Set Heath Key:! !C Assigns a function to a Heath special key.
For best results, use ^R Instant Extended Command to invoke this.
String Argument is name of function to assign.
You will be prompted to type the key to put the function on.

Alternatively, if you are calling this from your init file, you can pass
the key as a numeric arg.  In this case, the keys are coded as follows:

  0-9  unshifted keypad digits
 10    period
 11-19 shifted keypad digits (can't shift zero)
 20    ENTER (can't shift this, either)
 21-29 the 9 keys across the top (f1-f5, ERASE, blue,red,gray)
 30    Shift-ERASE.

You may also pass the function DEFINITION as a pre-comma arg, instead of
passing the function NAME as a string arg.!

!^R Bottom of Screen:! !^R Move cursor to bottom of screen.!

  -1:M(m.m^R_Move_to_Screen_Edge)

!^R Skip to Character:! !^R Skips to target character.
Skips forward to nth (or 1st) occurrence of next char typed.
Backward if arg is negative.  Edit bit on target ignored.
Repeat Skip with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.
Pre-comma arg gives char to search for (instead of reading it).!

  0U:Skip/Zap_State_Vector(2)	    !* flag that this is skip!
  . F(F @M(m.m&_Skip_to_Char)) M(m.m&_Maybe_Push_Point)

!& Skip to Char:! !S Implements Skip to Character.
This is a separate routine so that ^R Skip to Character can
do the Auto Push Point Option.  Optional pre-comma arg is the target char,
post-comma arg is repeat!

!* The var Skip/Zap State Vector is a 7-elt Q-vector that saves state of
skip/zap commands: <target char, repeat arg, zapflg, skip prompt, backskip
prompt, zap prompt, back zap prompt>.  The repeat arg is saved so you know the
direction of the skip/zap.  Zapflg is 1 if the command was Zap, 0 if Skip.
This all permits Repeat Skip/Zap to work.  The prompts are for M.I to use if
user is slow.!

!^R Reverse Skip:! !^R Search backward for target char.
I.e. like a backwards ^R Skip to Character.  Repeat with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.!

  0-@:M(M.M^R_Skip_to_Character) !* Just do it backward!

!^R Zap to Character:! !^R Kills text up to target character.
Zap excludes target character.  Negative arg zaps backward.
Repeat Zap with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.!

!^R Reverse Zap to Character:! !^R Zap backward to target char.
I.e. like a backwards ^R Zap to Character.  Repeat with ^R Repeat Skip/Zap.!

!* not on any key by default!

  0-@:M(M.M^R_Zap_to_Character) !* Just do it backward!

!^R Repeat Skip/Zap:! !^R Repeat the last Skip/Zap command
regardless of any intervening commands other than skip/zap!
