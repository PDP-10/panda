# Initial revision
# 
#
#	Given a list of words for ispell, generate a reduced list
#	in which all possible affixes have been collapsed.  The reduced
#	list will match the same list as the original.
#
#	Usage:
#
#	munchlist [-l lang] [-c lang] [-s hashfile] [-D] [-w chars] [file] ...
#
#	Options:
#
#	-l lang	Specifies the language table to be used.  The default
#		is "$LIBDIR/english.aff".
#	-c lang	Specifies "conversion" language table.  If this option is
#		given, the input file(s) will be assumed to be described by
#		this table, rather than the table given in the -l option.
#		This may be used to convert between incompatible language
#		tables.  (When in doubt, use this option -- it doesn't
#		hurt, and it may save you from creating a dictionary that has
#		illegal words in it).  The default is no conversion.
#	-T suff Specifies that the source word lists are in the format
#		of a "suff"-suffixed file, rather than in the
#		canonical form.  For example, "-T tex" specifies that
#		string characters in the word lists are in TeX format.
#		The string character conversions are taken from the language
#		table specified by the "-l" switch.
#	-s	Remove any words that are already covered by the
#		dictionary in 'hashfile'.  The words will be removed
#		only if all affixes are covered.  This option should not be
#		specified when the main dictionary is being munched.
#		'Hashfile' must have been created with the language
#		table given in the -l option, but this is not checked.
#	-D	Leave temporary files for debugging purposes
#	-w	Passed on to ispell (specify chars that are part of a word)
#		Unfortunately, special characters must be quoted twice
#		rather than once when invoking this script.  Also, since
#		buildhash doesn't accept this option, the final ispell -l
#		step ignores it, making it somewhat less than useful.
#
#	The given input files are merged, then processed by 'ispell -c'
#	to generate possible affix lists;  these are then combined
#	and reduced.  The final result is written to standard output.
#
#	For portability to older systems, I have avoided getopt.

# We now have a list of legal roots, and of affixes that apply to the

#		. > ERS
#
# the input "BOTHER" will generate an entry "BOTH/R" in CRUNCHEDINPUT.  But
# this will accept "BOTHER" and "BOTHERS" in the dictionary, which is
# wrong (in this case, though it's good English).
#
# To cure this problem, we first have to know which flags generate which
# expansions.  We use ispell -ee to expand the flags (the second e causes
# the root and flag to be included in the output), and run the result of
# that through sed to get pairs suitable for joining.  In the example
# above, we would get
#
#	BOTH/R BOTHER
#	BOTH/R BOTHERS
#
# We save this in EXPANDEDPAIRS for the next step.
#
# First, a small sed script that we'll use a lot.  It takes "a b c d" and
# produces "a b", "a c", and "a d".  Lines without blanks are ignored.

# It is somewhat easier to extract those which actually are listed (with
# join), and then use comm to strip these from EXPANDEDPAIRS to get the
# illegal expansions, together with the flags that generate them (we must
# re-sort EXPANDEDPAIRS before running comm).  Sed
# gets rid of the expansion and uniq gets rid of duplicates.  Comm then
# selects the remainder of the list from CRUNCHEDINPUT and puts it in
# LEGALFLAGLIST.  The final step is to use a sort and icombine to put
# the list into a one-entry-per-root format.
#
# BTW, I thought of using cut for the sed step (on systems that have it),
# but it turns out that sed is faster!

# LEGALFLAGLIST now contains root/flag combinations that, when expanded,
# produce only words from EXPANDEDPAIRS.  However, there is still a
# problem if the language tables have any cross-product flags.  A legal
# root may appear in LEGALFLAGLIST with two flags that participate
# in cross-products.  When such a dictionary entry is expanded,
# the cross-products will generate some extra words that may not
# be in EXPANDEDPAIRS.  We need to remove these from LEGALFLAGLIST.
#
# The first step is to collect the names of the flags that participate
# in cross-products.  Ispell will dump the language tables for us, and
# sed is a pretty handy way to strip out extra information.  We use
# uniq -c and a numerical sort to put the flags in approximate order of how
# "productive" they are (in terms of how likely they are to generate a lot
# of output words).  The least-productive flags are given last and will
# be removed first.

# We now have (in LEGALFLAGLIST) a list of roots and flags which will
# accept words taken from EXPANDEDINPUT and no others (though some of
# EXPANDEDINPUT is not covered by this list).  However, many of the
# expanded words can be generated in more than one way.  For example,
# "bather" can be generated from "bath/R" and "bathe/R".  This wastes
# unnecessary space in the raw dictionary and, in some cases, in the
# hash file as well.  The solution is to list the various ways of
# getting a given word and choose exactly one.  All other things being
# equal, we want to choose the one with the shortest root and the most
# flags.  The awk script takes care of this by providing us with a field
# to sort on.
#
# The ispell/awk combination is similar to the ispell/sed pipe
# used to generate EXPANDEDPAIRS, except that the awk adds an extra
# field giving the sort order.  The first sort gets things in order
# so the first root listed is the one we want, and the second sort (-um)
# then selects that first root.  Sed strips the expansion from the root,
# and a final sort -u generates MINIMALAFFIXES, the final list of affixes
# that (more or less) minimally covers what it can from EXPANDEDINPUT.
#
# Incidentally, the sed in the pipe below is necessary only because
# some versions of awk can't handle large numbers of fields (e.g.,
# over 100).  Otherwise we could just loop over the fields.
