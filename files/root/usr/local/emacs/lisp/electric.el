;; This loop is the guts for non-standard modes which retain control
;; until some event occurs.  It is a `do-forever', the only way out is to
;; throw.  It assumes that you have set up the keymap, window, and
;; everything else: all it does is read commands and execute them -
;; providing error messages should one occur (if there is no loop
;; function - which see).  The required argument is a tag which should
;; expect a value of nil if the user decides to punt. The
;; second argument is a prompt string (defaults to "->").  Given third
;; argument non-nil, it INHIBITS quitting unless the user types C-g at
;; toplevel.  This is so user can do things like C-u C-g and not get
;; thrown out.  Fourth argument, if non-nil, should be a function of two
;; arguments which is called after every command is executed.  The fifth
;; argument, if provided, is the state variable for the function.  If the
;; loop-function gets an error, the loop will abort WITHOUT throwing
;; (moral: use unwind-protect around call to this function for any
;; critical stuff).  The second argument for the loop function is the
;; conditions for any error that occurred or nil if none.

;; This function is like pop-to-buffer, sort of.

;; If there is a window displaying buffer
;; 	Select it
;; Else if there is only one window
;; 	Split it, selecting the window on the bottom with height being
;; 	the lesser of max-height (if non-nil) and the number of lines in
;;      the buffer to be displayed subject to window-min-height constraint.
;; Else
;; 	Switch to buffer in the current window.
;;
;; Then if max-height is nil, and not all of the lines in the buffer
;; are displayed, grab the whole screen.
;;
;; Returns selected window on buffer positioned at point-min.
