;;; This is a rudimentry backquote package written by D. King,
 ;;; king@kestrel, on 8/31/85.  (` x) is a macro
 ;;; that expands to a form that produces x.  (` (a b ..)) is
 ;;; a macro that expands into a form that produces a list of what a b
 ;;; etc. would have produced.  Any element can be of the form
 ;;; (, <form>) in which case the resulting form evaluates
 ;;; <form> before putting it into place, or (,@ <form>), in which
 ;;; case the evaluation of <form> is arranged for and each element
 ;;; of the result (which must be a (possibly null) list) is inserted.
;;; As an example, the immediately following macro push (v l) could
 ;;; have been written 
;;;    (defmacro push (v l)
;;;         (` (setq (, l) (cons (,@ (list v l))))))
 ;;; although
;;;    (defmacro push (v l)
;;;         (` (setq (, l) (cons (, v) (, l)))))
 ;;; is far more natural.  The magic atoms ,
 ;;; and ,@ are user-settable and list-valued.  We recommend that
 ;;; things never be removed from this list lest you break something
 ;;; someone else wrote in the dim past that comes to be recompiled in
 ;;; the distant future.

;;; LIMITATIONS: tail consing is not handled correctly.  Do not say
 ;;; (` (a . (, b))) - say (` (a (,@ b)))
 ;;; which works even if b is not list-valued.
;;; No attempt is made to handle vectors.  (` [a (, b) c]) doesn't work.
;;; Sorry, you must say things like
 ;;; (` (a (,@ 'b))) to get (a . b) and 
 ;;; (` ((, ',) c)) to get (, c) - [(` (a , b)) will work but is a bad habit]
;;; I haven't taught it the joys of nconc.
;;; (` atom) dies.  (` (, atom)) or anything else is okay.

;;; BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE
 ;;; inclusion of (,atom) rather than (, atom) or (,@atom) rather than
 ;;; (,@ atom) will result in errors that will show up very late.
 ;;; This is so crunchy that I am considering including a check for
 ;;; this or changing the syntax to ... ,(<form>).  RMS: opinion?

;;; a raft of general-purpose macros follows.  See the nearest
 ;;; Commonlisp manual.

;;; We develop the method for building the desired list from

;;; This function takes a form and returns what I will call a maker in
 ;;; what follows.  Evaluating the maker would produce the form,
 ;;; properly evaluated according to , and ,@ rules.
;;; I work backwards - it seemed a lot easier.  The reason for this is
 ;;; if I'm in some sort of a routine building a maker and I switch
 ;;; gears, it seemed to me easier to jump into some other state and
 ;;; glue what I've already done to the end, than to to prepare that
 ;;; something and go back to put things together.

 ;;; and then we either launch into the quoted case if the maker's
 ;;; top level function is quote, or into the comma case if it isn't.
