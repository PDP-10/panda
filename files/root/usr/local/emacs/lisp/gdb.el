;; Some ideas are due to  Masanobu. 

;; Description of GDB interface:

;; A facility is provided for the simultaneous display of the source code
;; in one window, while using gdb to step through a function in the
;; other.  A small arrow in the source window, indicates the current
;; line.

;; Starting up:

;; In order to use this facility, invoke the command GDB to obtain a
;; shell window with the appropriate command bindings.  You will be asked
;; for the name of a file to run.  Gdb will be invoked on this file, in a
;; window named *gdb-foo* if the file is foo.

;; M-s steps by one line, and redisplays the source file and line.

;; You may easily create additional commands and bindings to interact
;; with the display.  For example to put the gdb command next on \M-n
;; (def-gdb next "\M-n")

;; This causes the emacs command gdb-next to be defined, and runs
;; gdb-display-frame after the command.

;; gdb-display-frame is the basic display function.  It tries to display
;; in the other window, the file and line corresponding to the current
;; position in the gdb window.  For example after a gdb-step, it would
;; display the line corresponding to the position for the last step.  Or
;; if you have done a backtrace in the gdb buffer, and move the cursor
;; into one of the frames, it would display the position corresponding to
;; that frame.

;; gdb-display-frame is invoked automatically when a filename-and-line-number
;; appears in the output.
