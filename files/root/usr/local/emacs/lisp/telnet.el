  "This mode is for use during telnet from a buffer to another
host. It has most of the same commands as shell mode.
There is a variable `telnet-interrupt-string' which is the character
sent to try to stop execution of a job on the remote host.
Data is sent to the remote host when `return' is typed.
Thus if you may need to edit the data before sending you
should use c-n to move down a line.  Then you can return
to alter a previous line.  Of course you should not use this
mode of telnet if you want to run emacs like programs on the
remote host (at least not yet!).

The following commands imitate the usual Unix interrupt and
editing control characters:
\\{telnet-mode-map}

Bugs:
--Replace  by a space, really should remove.
--For Unix interacts poorly with tcsh although csh,sh,ksh are ok."
