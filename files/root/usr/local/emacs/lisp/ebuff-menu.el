  "Vaguely like ITS lunar select buffer;
combining typeoutoid buffer listing with menuoid buffer selection.

This pops up a buffer describing the set of emacs buffers.
If the very next character typed is a space then the buffer list
 window disappears.

Otherwise, one may move around in the buffer list window, marking
 buffers to be selected, saved or deleted.

To exit and select a new buffer, type Space when the cursor is on the
 appropriate line of the buffer-list window.

Other commands are much like those of buffer-menu-mode.

Calls value of  electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook  on entry if non-nil.
