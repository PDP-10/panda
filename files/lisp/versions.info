	Version 70505 of Lisp represents the first version designed
to be runable on either a DEC-10/Tenex or DEC-10/Tops20 system.  Tops20
is a DEC designed and supported operating system, similar to, and based
upon, Tenex.  The parent Lisp, obtained from Xerox-PARC, can be 
moved directly to either system, and if named according to local
conventions, can be expected to support programs written on either
system in the same Lisp.  This is a way of saying that an increase in
transportability of programs can be expected with this and subsequent
versions of Lisp.

	<LISP>CARHART.SAV;80402 is a version of Small Lisp (see
<DOC>LISP-SMALL-SLISP.INFO for details) which corresponds to
<LISP>LISP.SAV;80402.
