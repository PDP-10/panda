MAKE-INDIRECT  is a program which creates a small program in core which
does nothing except execute another program.  This is sometimes known as
a "pointer program."  

In the Interlisp context this is used so that all lisp core images can
remain on the directory <LISP> while pointers to the most current versions
reside on <SUBSYS>.  This is doubly useful because sysouts made from a
given version of Interlisp will not run unless the parent version is in
exactly the same place as when the sysout was made, and has exactly the
same name right down to the version number.

To run MAKE-INDIRECT type <LISP>MAKE-INDIRECT to the exec.  The progam
will prompt you for the name of the program to be pointed to and for
a six character string to appear in the SYSTAT when the program is running.

When the program stops you must explicitly save the core image.  To do so
type SAVE <esc> <esc> and the name of the pointer program.  The escapes
cause the exec to fill in the minimum range of core necessary to save the
pointer program.  Saving the entire core image will save MAKE-INDIRECT too!

The pointers may be renamed without affecting the programs they point to.
