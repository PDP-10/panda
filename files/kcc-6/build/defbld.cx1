! CSI Command file to set up cross-compiling for a TOPS-10 target system.
! There are three things that need to be redefined:
!	C:	To specify the location of include files and library rels.
!	CSYS:	Ditto for <sys/> include files
!	KCC	To identify the C compiler binary to use.  This is normally a
.define c:	as [311,4703]	! Same as CT10:
.define csys:	as [311,4706]	! Same as CINCS:
set definition KCC :== \irun c0:kcc;
