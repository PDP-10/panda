	/* Overview of how findcse works (from David Eppstein) */
      - In the first loop it goes back through the peephole buffer and
	builds up a list of instructions that taken together calculate
	the value in the target register (the one given it as an
	argument).  In this case the list will just be the LDB.

      - For each other register that can hold a computed value, in
	parallel and with the state of each parallel computation held
	in what is called in the comments a register match machine,
	it goes back through the peephole buffer and sees if the
	instructions which calculate the value in that other register
	match the built up list of instructions.  This is the big loop.

      - If we ever get such a match, then the built up list of
	instructions for the target register value is not necessary,
	because we can instead copy the value in the matching register
	and it will be the same.  This is the common subexpr elimination.
	The redundant instructions will be removed from the buffer and
	the register containing the result will be the return value.
	The caller might emit a MOVE or might just use that register.

      - If all machines don't match, i.e. they find an instruction
	which is part of how the value in their result registers was
	calculated but which isn't part of how the target value was
	calculated, then we know that the target value is not a common
	subexpression so we have to keep its calculation (and return
	zero to show that we are still using the old register).

      - If we get to the beginning of the peephole buffer without any
	machine matching then again there is no common subexpression.

Building the target calculation instruction list (the first loop) should
be pretty straightforward.  The second and longer loop is where the
match machines go about their work.  Actually what happens is that we
look at each instruction and there will usually be only one register
changed, so only one match machine needs to be activated.  If the
instruction changing the register is the same as the one the machine
expects then the machine advances to the next instruction in the list;
if it doesn't match the machine aborts.  Most of the state of each
machine can be found in matchedto[], which says which instruction it
wants to see next or whether it's aborted.

One complication is that we have to tell whether a register used as an
index was not changed between the machine's calculation's use of it
and the target calculation's use.  This information is kept in isindex[].
Isindex[reg] is the pointer to the earliest use of that register in
the target calculation; if any machines are not yet that far back when
we see an instruction changing that reg then all those machines are aborted.
There is a possible bug here if the same register is used twice as an
index in the target calculation, with a change to it in between the
two uses; if this situation happens the first loop that builds the
target calculation instruction list should abort because the second
loop can't handle this, but I don't know whether it currently does.
Something that probably hasn't come up but might be made to with
sufficiently tricky code.  You should check this anyway (not that it
is related to your current bug).

Another complication is that, because of IDIVI, the register that a
machine wakes up on is not always the same as the one it uses as the
common subexpression value after a successful match.  There is another
array that keeps track of this information (I forget the name).

Yet another complication is to take care of instructions that can be
skipped over.  There is a SKIPPED field in the address mode type of
each instruction which the code should be looking at (I am pretty sure
it does but it's been a while).

The minor function of findcse was that it turned out to be convenient
to put ILDB folding there.  LDB folding only happens when there is a
single LDB (or DPB) as the target calculation.  If we find a matching
LDB first, this is just a common subexpression like any other.  But if
we find an IBP, then we want to turn both instructions into an ILDB.
Currently there is one thing which inhibits this, the jumped flag.  If
we move back across a jump out of the peephole buffer, this is not a
problem for common subexpressions but you don't want to pull the IBP
across the jump because then it won't happen if the jump gets taken.
