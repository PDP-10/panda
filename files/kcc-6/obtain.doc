			HOW TO OBTAIN KCC

There are two ways to get a copy of the KCC PDP-10 C compiler: FTP and tape.

FTP:
	If you are fortunate enough to be able to make an Internet
TCP/IP connection to NIC.DDN.MIL, you can transfer the distribution
files directly.  Establish a FTP connection to SRI-NIC, log in as
"anonymous" with a random password, and then retrieve the file
KCCDIST:INSTAL.DOC.  This will explain the rest of what you need to
know.  If you have problems, send electronic mail to
<BUG-KCC@NIC.DDN.MIL>.

Tape:
	If you do not have access to NIC.DDN.MIL via TCP/IP then the
alternative is to ask for a magnetic tape.  A distribution tape
normally consists of a 9-track 1600 bpi tape with a single saveset
written by TOPS-20 DUMPER, and includes all of the sources and
documentation.  A charge is necessary to cover the cost of the
materials, postage, and operator time.  Mail your request, with a check
for US $200 payable to "SRI International", to:

	Network Information Center, Room EJ291
	SRI International
	333 Ravenswood Avenue
	Menlo Park, California 94025

If you have further questions or encounter problems, you can contact:
	Ken Harrenstien		<KLH@NIC.DDN.MIL>
	Phone: 415/859-6552
	(postal address same as above, except use Room EJ200 instead)
