	This directory contains all the source code for the standard C
math library.  Most of the routines were taken from Fred Fish's Portable
Math Library (PML); his code has been modified to use the standard error
reporting scheme (errno), and to conform to the description of the math
library as given in Harbison & Steele's "C: A Reference Manual", section
11.3.  The rest of the routines are SRI creations.

	MATH.H is the header file and also contains constant definitions
needed by some PML functions.  The program MTEST can be used to verify
the math functions and determine their precision.

	The library consists of:

    int abs(x);			PRIMITIVE: C code
    double acos(x);	PML	based on atan()
    double asin(x);	PML	based on atan()
    double atan(x);	PML	PRIMITIVE: uses _sign(), _poly()
    double atan2(y,x);	PML	based on atan()
    double ceil(x);		based on modf()
    double cos(x);	PML	PRIMITIVE: uses fmod(), sin(), sqrt(), _poly()
    double cosh(x);	PML	based on exp()
    double exp(x);	PML	PRIMITIVE: uses _sign(), fabs(), modf(), ldexp()
    double fabs(x);		PRIMITIVE: C code
    double floor(x);		based on modf()
    double fmod(x,y);		based on modf()
    double frexp(x,nptr);	PRIMITIVE: mach dep C code
    long labs(x);		PRIMITIVE: C code
    double ldexp(x,n);		PRIMITIVE: mach dep C code
    double log(x);	PML	based on _xexp(), _xmant(), _poly()
    double log10(x);	PML	based on log()
    double modf(x,nptr);	PRIMITIVE: mach dep assembly code
    double pow(x,y);	PML	based on exp(), log(), modf()
    int rand();			PRIMITIVE: mach dep C code
    double sin(x);	PML	PRIMITIVE: uses fmod(), cos(), sqrt(), _poly()
    double sinh(x);	PML	based on exp()
    double sqrt(x);	PML	based on _xexp(), _xmant(), ldexp()
    srand(seed);		PRIMITIVE: C code
    double tan(x);	PML	based on sin(), cos()
    double tanh(x);	PML	based on exp()

additional support routines:

    double _sign(x, y);		PML	PRIMITIVE: C code
    double _poly(x,y,z);	PML	PRIMITIVE: C code
    int _xexp(x);		PML	PRIMITIVE: mach dep C code
    double _xmant(x);		PML	PRIMITIVE: mach dep C code
