   The TOPS-20 ARPANET user utility programs allow users  to  connect  to
   remote  sites on the Advanced Research Agency NETwork (ARPANET) and to
   function as local users at the  remote  site.   Once  connected  to  a
   remote site, you have access to the resources of the remote site.  You
   will be able to create directories; create, edit,  and  run  programs;
   create  and  edit files; transfer files and data between the local and
   the remote site; communicate with users at both the local  and  remote
   site; and obtain information about sites and the status of connections
   between sites.

   The following utility programs are described in this manual:

         o  The TELNET program, which  allows  you  to  communicate  with
            remote sites (Chapter 2)

         o  The FTP program, which allows you to transfer files and  data
            between local and remote sites (Chapter 3)

         o  The TSTATS program, which allows you to check the  status  of
            host connections (Chapter 4)

         o  The IPHOST program, which allows you to get information about
            hosts.   IPHOST  also allows an operator to cycle the ARPANET
            (Chapter 5)

   2.1  INTRODUCTION   2.1  INTRODUCTION

   TELNET is  a  TOPS-20  utility  that  provides  communication  between
   ARPANET  hosts  by  establishing  a  connection  between a local and a
   remote host.  This connection makes it appear as if you  are  a  local
   user  at  the  remote  site.   TELNET  accomplishes this by converting
   terminals attached to a host running TOPS-20 software  into  a  TELNET
   connection.



   2.2  USERS AND SERVERS   2.2  USERS AND SERVERS

   ARPANET installations, including Terminal Access  Controllers  (TACs),
   are  classified  as  users  or  servers.   These  terms  are  used  to
   distinguish the manner in which resources are shared.  The  terms  are
   also  used  to  determine  the  roles  of  each  host  during a TELNET
   connection.

   The  way  resources  are  shared  is  established  by   each   ARPANET
   installation.   A  server  installation shares its resources among all
   ARPANET sites.  A user uses the resources of other sites, but does not
   share  its  resources.  The classification of a resource as a user may
   be determined by security requirements or by lack of resources at  the
   site.   TACs, for example, have no resources to share.  Do not attempt
   a TELNET connection to a host classified as a user.

   The terms user and server also define the function of  the  two  hosts
   during  a  TELNET  connection.   Used  in  this  manner, the term user
   designates the host that is using the resources of another site.   The
   server  is  providing the service.  For example, two sites, Host A and
   Host B, are classified as servers.  Host A establishes a connection to
   Host  B.   For  the  duration  of  the  TELNET  connection,  Host A is
   classified as a user, and Host B acts as a server.

   In addition to an understanding of the terms user and server, you must
   also  be  aware of the rules governing TELNET connections at your site


                                    2-1
                             THE TELNET PROGRAM                             THE TELNET PROGRAM


   and at the remote site.  Check with your System Manager regarding  the
   rules  and  times  for TELNET connections.  Also, become familiar with
   the requirements of the remote sites to which  you  make  connections.
   This  is  necessary  because  some  sites  require  that you set up an
   account with a specific individual at their site.  Some sites  require
   a  password  unique to the individual user, while others allow a group
   password such as "guest".  Some sites restrict TELNET connections to a
   designated  time  interval.   Reading the ARPANET RESOURCE HANDBOOK, a
   publication of the Network Information Center (NIC), is  helpful.   At
   least  one  copy  is  available at each ARPANET site.  The handbook is
   organized by sites and contains such information as:

         o  Address and personnel contacts

         o  Main function and interest

         o  Tables containing  host  names  and  addresses,  IMP  number,
            status (Server, User, TAC)

         o  Service schedules

         o  Typical load and peak load time

         o  Hardware and operating system



   2.3  CREATING A TELNET CONNECTION   2.3  CREATING A TELNET CONNECTION

   Creating  a  satisfactory  TELNET  connection  is  basic  to   TELNET.
   Therefore,   understanding   the   principles   of   TELNET   protocol
   negotiations helps you:

         o  Request added (more sophisticated) capabilities

         o  Request different capabilities

         o  Avoid option commands that will not be honored

         o  Avoid unnecessary option commands

         o  Make efficient use of available commands

   TELNET  negotiations  for  assigning  capabilities   to   the   TELNET
   connection  and  the TELNET connection itself are invisible to you.  A
   completed connection appears to be direct.

                             THE TELNET PROGRAM                             THE TELNET PROGRAM


   What appears to happen:




   The program has already  created  the  TELNET  connection.   Refer  to
   Figure  2-1  for  a  more  accurate  and  complete diagram of a TELNET
   connection.

   Once you type the TELNET command, a set of  "current  modes"  for  the
   TELNET  connection is available to you and TELNET.  These values, such
   as local echo, are a set of minimal capabilities that  most  hosts  on
   the   ARPANET   possess.    The  current  modes  form  the  basis  for
   negotiations; they are the default modes  and  exist  for  the  TELNET
   connection except as specifically changed by TELNET negotiations.

   Following the establishment of the connection, TELNET has access to:

         o  The default values

         o  The actual capabilities of the user terminal

         o  The actual capabilities of the server terminal

         o  The preferences of user and server

            --  As they exist in files (such files are  helpful  but  are
                optional)

            --  As given in TELNET commands by user or server

   TELNET considers all the above factors and selects  a  set  of  values
   representing  a "best fit" for the TELNET connection.  TELNET resolves
   differences in capabilities  and  option  requests  according  to  the
   following practices:

         o  A server is expected to allow a  user  all  terminal  options
            that the server supplies to local users.

         o  Either party to a proposed connection may refuse to change  a
            default mode.  Each party must accept the other's refusal.

         o  All hosts are expected to use their local terminal in such  a
            way  as  to  appear to be dealing with the TELNET connection.
            For example, if the TELNET connection has been negotiated  as
            having  local  echo,  both  hosts for this connection must be
            prepared to interpret local echo.

         o  Option requests may be made  during  the  TELNET  session  to
            change  the  TELNET  connection  to suit a changed condition.
            Option requests may then be negotiated  back  to  the  TELNET
            connection.

         o  A rejected option request  should  never  be  repeated  until
            something  changes.  For example, wait until a different task
            or information is received from the other end.

         o  A bidirectional 7- or 8-bit byte is the facility supported by
            the TOPS-20 user TELNET program.  The most significant bit is
            controlled by the TRANSPARENT command.  See Section 2.9 for a
            discussion of the TRANSPARENT command.

   Most TELNET connections are negotiated by the program.  Connections to
   hosts  with  very different hardware/software facilities, however, may
   require several option requests.



   2.4  TERMINAL INPUT MODES   2.4  TERMINAL INPUT MODES

   Because TELNET communicates with foreign hosts,  TELNET  distinguishes
   between  terminal input that is a command to the program, and terminal
   input  that  is  part  of   the   user-to-server   or   server-to-user
   communication.  TALK mode and EXTENDED TALK mode serve these functions
   in TELNET.

   When a connection to a TELNET remote host is  established,  you  enter
   TALK mode.  In this mode, you are talking directly to the remote host.
   You are no longer dealing with the TELNET command protocol.  The  only
   exceptions to this rule are:

         o  If you are  not  in  TRANSPARENT  mode,  TALK  mode  will  be
            affected.  TRANSPARENT mode is discussed in Section 2.9.

         o  OPAQUE and PAGE mode also affect TALK mode.  These modes  are
            discussed in Section 2.10.

         o  If you  hit  the  escape  character,  you  are  automatically
            returned to Command level.

   TALK mode is the only mode in which many of the  TELNET  commands  and
   arguments  are  valid.   Command  descriptions  note  whether  or  not
   commands are valid in TALK mode.

   EXTENDED TALK mode allows you to return to the local host  to  perform
   certain  tasks,  such  as  logging  file usage or renegotiating TELNET
   parameters, without interfering with the  terminal  function  you  are
   performing  at  the remote host.  Once a command has been completed in
   EXTENDED TALK mode, you are  returned  to  TALK  mode.   Enabling  the
   EXTENDED TALK function of TELNET is discussed in Section 2.9.

   Generally, EXTENDED TALK mode is entered from TALK mode.  If, however,
   you  create  a  TELNET.CMD  file (see Section 2.11 for a discussion of
   TELNET.CMD files), you can enter EXTENDED TALK mode  as  soon  as  you
   establish  a  TELNET connection.  Command descriptions note whether or

   2.5  RUNNING TELNET   2.5  RUNNING TELNET

   To run the TELNET program, you must  already  be  logged  in  to  your
   system.   You  can  determine if the ARPANET is available by using the
   INFORMATION (ABOUT) ARPANET-STATUS command.  This  command  gives  you
   information about the ARPANET status:

        @INFORMATION (ABOUT) ARPANET <RET>
         ARPANET service is enabled
         The IMP interface is up
         Most recent IMP ready line on-transition: 15-Dec-83 03:10:28
         Most recent IMP ready line off-transition: 15-Dec-83 03:03:17
        @

   To run TELNET, type TELNET in response to the TOPS-20 prompt.  You are
   then  prompted  with  the  TELNET  prompt  followed  by  a right angle
   bracket(>), as in:

        @TELNET <RET>
         TELNET>

   Following this prompt, type the name, nickname, or host id of the host
   you  are  attempting  to  connect  to.   You  then  receive  a message
   indicating the status of the connection that is being  attempted.   In
   the following example, there is a successful connection to the foreign
   host.

   EXAMPLE:

        Market - LCG's Timesharing System, TOPS-20 Monitor 5.3(5000)
        @LOGIN PAETZOLD (PASSWORD)    <RET>
         Job 29 on TTY233 15-Dec-83 14:02:82
        @TELNET <RET>
         TELNET>RADC-TOPS20 <RET>
        Trying...Open

   In the next  example,  however,  TELNET  can  not  make  a  successful
   connection.   This  example  assumes that you are already logged in to
   your system.

   EXAMPLE:  @TELNET<RET>
              TELNET>SU-SCORE<RET>
               Trying...Host dead, not scheduled up, up on Wednesday at 3:00 P.M. EST
             @

   If you are not able to make a successful connection, either  choose  a
   different  host  or  attempt a connection at the time indicated by the
   TELNET message.  For a list  of  available  TELNET  hosts,  check  the

   ARPANET RESOURCE HANDBOOK.

   Once you are  connected  to  an  ARPANET  site  by  means  of  TELNET,
   typically  the  herald  for  that system appears.  (Some ARPANET sites
   have no herald.  At this point, it is necessary for you to log  in  to
   the  remote system.  Most ARPANET sites provide any unique information
   needed to log in to that site.  Therefore, be sure to read the  herald
   before you attempt to log in to the foreign host.

   The example below shows the procedure  for  logging  in  to  your  own
   system and then establishing a TELNET connection and logging in to the
   foreign host.

   2.5.1  CONNECT Command   2.5.1  CONNECT Command

   The CONNECT command can be used to establish a TELNET connection to  a
   remote site.  The CONNECT command takes the form:

        @TELNET CONNECT HOST-ID <RET>

   where HOST-ID is the name of the remote site you want to  connect  to.
   Using the CONNECT command eliminates the TELNET> prompt.

   The following is an example of the CONNECT command:

        @TELNET CONNECT DEC-MARLBORO
         Trying...Open
        Market - LCG'S Timesharing System, TOPS-20 Monitor 5.3(5000)
        @

   The CONNECT command is also  used  to  establish  a  connection  to  a
   specified   host  on  a  designated  contact  port.   For  a  detailed
   explanation of ports, see the following section.  To use  the  CONNECT
   command  to establish a connection on a specified port, you must be in
   EXTENDED TALK mode.  The CONNECT command takes the form:

        CONNECT (TO) INTERNET (HOST) host (ON PORT) port

   where host is either a recognized host name or a network name followed
   by  four  8-bit  decimal numbers specifying the fields of the INTERNET
   address.  The numbers are separated from each other by periods.

   The port specification for an  INTERNET  connection  consists  of  two
   8-bit decimal numbers from 1 to 255, separated by a period or a space.
   The port default is 0,23.

   An example of the use of the INTERNET CONNECT command is given below:

   2.5.2  TELNET Ports   2.5.2  TELNET Ports

   TELNET utilizes ports with the CONNECT  command  when  establishing  a
   connection  to  a  particular  TELNET  task.   Once  the task has been
   executed by TELNET, the connection is closed by the remote host.

   The argument line for the use of ports takes the form:

        TELNET>CONNECT (TO) INTERNET (HOST) host name (ON PORT) port

   where host name is the name of a recognized host name or host id  (see
   the ARPANET Handbook) and port is one of the following:

        DAYTIME         DISCARD    ECHO       FINGER   FTP
        OLD-TELNET      SYSTAT     TELNET     TEXT     TTYTST

   You can use recognition and a question mark for  help  in  typing  the
   correct argument line.

   TELNET then establishes a connection to the remote host, performs  the
   task,  and closes the connection.  The following example shows the use
   of ports in a TELNET session.

        TELNET>INTERNET (HOST) DEC-MARLBORO (ON PORT) SYSTAT <RET>

   2.6  EXITING TELNET   2.6  EXITING TELNET

   Two commands are used to exit from TELNET:  CLOSE and EXIT.

   To exit from TELNET TALK mode using the CLOSE command, type  <CTRL/~>C
   in response to the TELNET command prompt.  The <CTRL/~>C is not echoed
   on your terminal.  You are then informed that the connection has  been
   closed:

        Command: <CTRL/~>C
        Connection closed
        @

   The CLOSE (Connection) command closes the network  connection  to  the
   remote  host  from EXTENDED TALK mode.  Using this command returns you
   to the TOPS-20 command level.  To use this command, type:

        TELNET>CLOSE <RET>
        @

   The EXIT or Quit (from TELNET) command returns you  to  command  level
   without closing the network connection.  To use this command, type:

        TELNET>EXIT <RET>
        TELNET>



   2.7  GETTING HELP WITH TELNET   2.7  GETTING HELP WITH TELNET

   There are two ways of getting  help  in  using  TELNET.   Typing  a  ?
   provides  information  on  the  single  command  or  message  that  is
   currently being displayed on the terminal.  After typing  the  ?   and
   getting  help,  you  are  prompted  for  the  next  argument needed to
   complete your command:

        TELNET>ESCAPE (CHARACTER IS)? escape character in quotes
          or ASCII code for character in octal

   To get information  on  running  the  TELNET  program,  use  the  HELP
   command.   Typing  either  HELP  or  TELNET  HELP in response to the @
   prompt prints a brief help text on how to use TELNET.



   2.8  TELNET COMMAND CHARACTER   2.8  TELNET COMMAND CHARACTER

   The TELNET protocol sends data to the foreign host.  This data is  not
   interpreted by TELNET.  It is only transmitted across the network.

   The ^^character, which is the ASCII character 36, is the basic command
   character TELNET uses to control the transmission of data.  On a VT100
   series terminal, this character is entered as <CTRL/~>.

   The  <CTRL/~>  is  the  TELNET  command  character.   This   character
   interacts  with the TELNET program.  The command character is followed
   by an additional character to specify the action to be taken.  If  the
   command  character  is followed by itself, as in <CTRL/~><CTRL/~>, the
   command character is transmitted to the remote host.

   The command character is not echoed on  your  terminal.   However,  in
   this manual, command characters are shown in the examples.



   2.9  TELNET COMMANDS   2.9  TELNET COMMANDS

   TELNET commands are specified by typing the TELNET  command  character
   <CTRL/~> followed by another character that specifies the action to be
   taken, as in <CTRL/~>P.  The command sequence that  you  type  is  not
   echoed on your terminal.

   Some of the TELNET commands are only legal in TALK mode, while  others
   can  only be used in EXTENDED TALK mode.  These commands are explained
   in detail below.


   ________ ____ ___ ________   QUESTION MARK (?) COMMAND:

   The Question Mark command, which is input by typing a <CTRL/~>?, gives
   information  about  what is needed to complete your current task.  The
   following example shows the use of the ?  command:

        <CTRL/~>?
        Type a single character command:
        ?   This message
        A   Send ATTN
        B   Send BREAK
        C   Close connection
        O   Abort output
        P   Push to inferior EXEC

        S   Status of TELNET connection
        Q   Quit
        T   Transparent Mode toggle
        X   Enter extended command mode
        Typing the escape character twice sends it to the host.
        Command:


   ____ _____ ________   ATTN (KEY) COMMAND:

   The ATTN command can only be used in TALK mode.  Its  function  is  to
   send   the  TELNET  "interrupt  process"  protocol  sequence  for  the
   "Attention" signal.  This command is used primarily for MULTICS or IBM
   systems.  To use this command, type <CTRL/~>A in TALK mode,as shown in
   the following example:

        <CTRL/~>A


   _____ ________   BREAK COMMAND:

   The BREAK command can only be  used  in  TALK  mode.   Use  the  Break
   command  to send the TELNET "break" sequence and to terminate whatever
   task is being performed at the remote host.  To use this command, type
   CTRL/~B in TALK mode, as in the following example:

        <CTRL/~>B


   _____ ____________ ________   CLOSE (CONNECTION) COMMAND:

   As discussed previously, the CLOSE command is one  method  of  exiting
   from  TELNET and closing the ARPANET connection.  When you are in TALK
   mode, typing the <CTRL/~>C returns you to the  TELNET  command  level.
   When  in  EXTENDED  TALK  mode, typing CLOSE in response to the TELNET
   prompt closes the connection and returns you to TELNET command  level.
   An example of the use of the CLOSE command is given below.

   Using the CLOSE command from TALK mode:

        <CTRL/~>C
        Connection closed by foreign host

   Using the CLOSE Command from EXTENDED TALK mode:

        TELNET>Close <RET>
        Connection closed by foreign host


   _____ ________ ________   ABORT (OUTPUT) COMMAND:

   The ABORT command is legal  only  in  TALK  mode.   When  you  type  a


                                    2-10
                             THE TELNET PROGRAM                             THE TELNET PROGRAM


   <CTRL/~>O, the TELNET "abort output" signal is sent to the remote host
   and any output from the remote host is halted.  To use  this  command,
   type:

        <CTRL/~>O


   ____ ________ ______ ________   PUSH (COMMAND LEVEL) COMMAND:

   You can use the PUSH command in either TALK  or  EXTENDED  TALK  mode.
   The  PUSH  command  functions in the same manner as it does at TOPS-20
   command level.  Use this command when you wish to perform  a  task  at
   your local host.  When you have completed the task, typing POP returns
   you to TELNET TALK mode.

   Not only is the PUSH command useful for doing a temporary task at  the
   local host and then returning to TELNET, the command also protects you
   against accidentally logging  out  while  you  still  have  an  active
   connection.   You  cannot  log  out  once  you  have executed the PUSH
   command.

   To use this command in TALK mode, type <CTRL/~>P as in:

        <CTRL/~>P

   To use this command in EXTENDED TALK mode, type PUSH  in  response  to
   the TELNET command prompt, as in:

        TELNET>PUSH <RET>


   ______ ___ ______ ___________ ________   STATUS (OF TELNET CONNECTION) COMMAND:

   The STATUS command allows you to ask the remote host to send a message
   indicating  that it is still available.  This command is only legal in
   TALK  mode.   Most  often  you  receive  a  job/system  message   that
   identifies  the  remote  host.   The minimum response you receive is a
   yes.

   To use the STATUS command, type <CTRL/~>S in response  to  the  TELNET
   prompt.   Neither  the  control nor the command character is echoed on

   ____ ___________ ______ ________   [NO] TRANSPARENT (MODE) COMMAND:

   The TRANSPARENT command controls whether or not the  most  significant
   bit  of  the 8-bit character (also called the edit key) is transmitted
   to the remote host as an editing character.   This  command  is  legal
   only  in  TALK mode.  In TRANSPARENT mode, the edit key functions as a
   character modifier at the remote  host.   When  the  [NO]  TRANSPARENT
   command  is chosen, the edit key is suppressed and cannot be used as a
   character modifier.

   To enable TRANSPARENT mode, type either <CTRL/~>T or TRANSPARENT.   To
   suppress  the  edit  key,  use  the  NO TRANSPARENT command, which you
   enable by typing a double <CTRL/~>T.

   The following example  shows  the  use  of  the  TRANSPARENT  command.
   Remember  neither  the  control  character nor the single character is
   echoed on your terminal.

        <CTRL/~>T


   ____ ________ ________ ____ _____________ ____ ______ _________ ______   [NO] EXTENDED (COMMAND MODE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN ESCAPE CHARACTER TYPED)
   ________   COMMAND:

   The EXTENDED command controls entry into the  EXTENDED  TALK  mode  of
   TELNET.   You  can  use  the  EXTENDED  command in two ways:  to enter
   EXTENDED TALK mode immediately  upon  entering  TELNET,  or  to  enter
   EXTENDED TALK mode from TALK mode.

   If you have created a TELNET.CMD file,  you  can  place  the  EXTENDED
   command  in  this  file.   If you use the EXTENDED command, you bypass
   TALK mode and automatically enter EXTENDED TALK mode when you  make  a
   TELNET  connection.   The  default  for the EXTENDED command is the NO
   EXTENDED command.  If the default is used, you enter  TALK  mode  when
   you enter TELNET.

                                    NOTE

           If you set  EXTENDED  in  your  TELNET.CMD  file,  you
           cannot  send  the  escape  character  <CTRL/~>  to the
           remote host.

   The EXTENDED command can also be used from TALK mode.  When you are in
   TALK  mode,  typing  <CTRL/~>X places you in EXTENDED TALK mode.  This
   allows you to perform certain TELNET tasks at your local site  without
   interfering with the task being performed at the remote site.



   2.10  CHANGING TELNET PARAMETERS   2.10  CHANGING TELNET PARAMETERS

   Four  commands  are  available  for   changing   TELNET   transmission
   parameters:   ECHO,  LINE,  OPAQUE, and PAGE.  Descriptions of each of
   these commands are given below.


   ____ ____ ___ ______ _____ ________   [NO] ECHO (BY REMOTE HOST) COMMAND:

   The ECHO command controls which host performs echoing of  user  input.
   When  the NO ECHO command is enabled, echoing occurs at the local host
   and is  under  TELNET  protocol  control.   If  the  ECHO  command  is
   specified,  the  remote  host  handles echoing.  The ECHO parameter is
   part of TELNET negotiations and must be agreed to by the remote  host.
   If  the  remote  host does not agree to handle echoing, TELNET reverts
   back to local echo.   On  most  occasions,  TELNET  negotiates  remote
   echoing when establishing the TELNET connection.

   Once a connection is in effect, ECHO or NO ECHO can be  used  only  in
   TALK mode.  To use the ECHO command, type:

        @TELNET>ECHO<RET>


   ____ ____ _______ ___ _____ ____ ____________ ________   [NO] LINE (EDITOR FOR LOCAL ECHO CONNECTIONS) COMMAND:

   The LINE command controls the use of the  TOPS-20  editing  characters
   rubout,  CTRL/R,  CTRL/W,  and  CTRL/U, as well as the manner in which
   text is sent to the remote host.  The LINE command can  be  used  only
   when local echoing is in effect.

   When the LINE command is enabled,  the  rubout,  CTRL/R,  CTRL/W,  and
   CTRL/U  characters  can  be used.  Also, no text is sent to the remote
   host until a carriage return or  a  line  feed  is  typed.   The  LINE
   command is useful for connections to a line-oriented system.

   To use the LINE command, type LINE in response to the TELNET prompt:

        @TELNET>LINE <RET>


   ____ ______ ______ ________   [NO] OPAQUE (MODE) COMMAND:

   The OPAQUE command controls the degree of local terminal handling that
   is  done during a TELNET session.  When the OPAQUE command is enabled,


                                    2-13
                             THE TELNET PROGRAM                             THE TELNET PROGRAM


   the local host continues to  handle  such  functions  as  padding  and
   keeping  track  of  the  cursor's  position.   The  OPAQUE  command is
   generally used with terminals whose capabilities  are  different  than
   the terminal you are working on.

   In addition, when the OPAQUE command is enabled,  nulls  are  ignored;
   and character conversion may take place.  You will, in most instances,
   not be able to use a display editor at the remote  host.   The  OPAQUE
   and  PAGE  commands  must  both  be enabled in order to have automatic
   holding at the end of the terminal screen.

   The NO OPAQUE command is the TELNET default.  The  NO  OPAQUE  command
   specifies that the remote host will handle all terminal functions.  No
   local terminal handling is done.

   To use the OPAQUE command, type  OPAQUE  in  response  to  the  TELNET
   prompt, as in the following example:

        TELNET>OPAQUE<RET>


   ____ ____ ______ ________   [NO] PAGE (MODE) COMMAND:

   The PAGE command controls  whether  or  not  the  local  host  handles
   terminal  paging.   When  the  PAGE command is enabled, the local host
   handles paging using the CTRL/Q and CTRL/S characters.   There  is  no
   way  to  send  these characters to the remote host.  If you enable the
   PAGE command, you should also enable the OPAQUE command,  since  these
   commands,  used  jointly,  tell  the local host how many lines of text
   have been input.

   Use the PAGE command when you need to have paging in  effect  and  the
   remote  host will not or can not handle this task.  For example, VT100
   terminals in smooth scroll  mode  require  faster  handling  than  the
   networks allow.

   NO PAGE is the TELNET default command.  When the NO PAGE command is in
   effect,  the  CTRL/Q  and  CTRL/S  characters are passed to the remote
   host.

   To use the PAGE command, type PAGE in response to the  TELNET  prompt,
   as in the following example:

        TELNET>PAGE<RET>



   2.11  CREATING A TELNET.CMD FILE   2.11  CREATING A TELNET.CMD FILE

   A TELNET.CMD file, which is automatically read when you invoke TELNET,
   is  used  to  change  TELNET's  default  behavior.   If  you want your
   terminal to have command characters from a previous version of TELNET,


                                    2-14

   you can place these commands in your TELNET.CMD file.

   For example, if you want Y  for  the  intercept  character,  immediate
   entry  into  EXTENDED  TALK  mode, and OPAQUE mode (see Section 2.10),
   create a TELNET.CMD file that contains the following:

        ESCAPE 031 ;or a quoted control-y
        EXTENDED
        OPAQUE
        PAGE

   To determine how to define a command in your TELNET.CMD file,  consult
                             _______ ______ _____   the latest version of the TOPS-20 User's Guide.



   2.12  CREATING A TELNET LOG FILE   2.12  CREATING A TELNET LOG FILE

   To create a file that contains a transcript of  your  TELNET  session,
   use the LOG command.  The command takes the form:

        LOG (FILE IS) log file name

   Where log file name is the name you choose for your file.  The default
   file name for a log file is TELNET.LOG.

   TELNET's default is not to keep a log.  If you want to have a log, you
   must  use  the  LOG  command.   Note  that  the  LOG command only logs
   information from the foreign host.

   A CLOSE command automatically closes  the  log  file.   However,  when
   another connection is opened, the log file is reopened for append.

   If you decide during your session that you no longer want a log  file,
   you can use the NO LOG command.  To use this command, type:

        @TELNET>NO LOG<RET>

   This closes your log file.

   The following example shows the creation of a log file.

        @TELNET>LOG (FILE IS)TELNET.TXT <RET>



   2.13  TAKING COMMANDS FROM FILES   2.13  TAKING COMMANDS FROM FILES

   TELNET accepts commands from specified input files by using  the  TAKE
   command.  At the end of the file, TELNET reverts to accepting commands
   from the  terminal.   In  addition,  TELNET  automatically  reads  the
   TELNET.CMD file at start-up.

   To use the TAKE command, type TAKE in response to the  TELNET  prompt,
   followed  by  the  name of the input file from which you want commands
   taken:

        TELNET>TAKE (Commands from file)input filespec <RET>

   where input filespec is the name of the file that  you  want  commands
   taken from.



   2.14  TELNET MESSAGES   2.14  TELNET MESSAGES

   The most common TELNET messages, with their descriptions and suggested
   user  responses,  are  listed  alphabetically  below.   Some  of these
   messages are informational, describing  that  conditions  are  normal.
   These messages merely confirm that TELNET is doing what you requested.
   Other messages indicate an error at the remote site.  These errors are
   not user errors.  The user has no control over them.

   When TELNET is unable to continue with a user command, it outputs  one
   of  the  error  messages  listed  below.   Generally, any TAKE file or
   command that is in progress is  aborted.   These  errors  are  usually
   errors  in  the  user's command line.  In the list below, fatal errors
   are preceded by a question mark (?), and warning messages are preceded
   by a percent sign (%).


   ?Abnormal fork termination interrupt

        TELNET's network input fork died involuntarily.   Because  TELNET
        is  supposed  to  check for all error conditions, this message is
        not expected to appear.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Contact the system people at your  site
        if this message appears on the terminal.

   ?Can't continue

        It is not possible to continue TELNET after a fatal error.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Restart the TELNET program.

   ?Character doesn't have a control form

        You gave the CONTROL command with an argument that cannot be made
        into a control character.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Respecify an argument that can be  made
        into a control character and issue the control command.

        The user gave a CLOSE command.  TELNET is confirming that it  has
        closed the connection.

   Connection closed by foreign host

        The remote host has closed the connection for  reasons  known  to
        itself, but not to TELNET.  For example, many hosts "hang up" the
        connection when you log out.  TELNET takes  the  same  action  it
        does when you give a CLOSE command.

   Foreign host sent a subnegotiation

        The remote host is using the subnegotiation part  of  the  TELNET
        protocol.   Since TELNET does not allow subnegotiations, the host
        is violating protocol.  Some garbage  may  follow  this  message.
        This message is not expected to appear.

   Insufficient system resources

        TOPS-20's network connection tables are full; there  is  no  room
        for a new connection.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Try connecting at a later time.

   ?Invalid ASCII value

        The number specified for the escape characters was not between  0
        and 177 octal.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Specify a  number  between  0  and  177
        octal.

   ?Invalid port number

        The number given was out of range for the named field.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Specify a number  that  is  within  the
        range of the named field.

   ?Log file error-...more details...

        TELNET was unable  to  reopen  the  log  file  when  opening  the
        connection.  The log file has been turned off, and the connection
        continues without it.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Correct the condition indicated in  the
        error  message,  and  reissue  a  LOG command if you still want a
        transcript of your session.

   ?...message...

        A miscellaneous nonfatal error occurred.  This is usually a  user

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Correct the  error  and  try  the  task
        again.

   ?...message...,...instruction...at PC=...PC value...

        A fatal error has occurred.  The PC printed is  the  location  of
        the error.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Contact the system people at your  site
        if this problem occurs.

   ?Must have CONTROL-C capability to run TELNET

        The superior fork has  denied  TELNET  the  <CTRL/C>  capability,
        which  is  necessary  for  TELNET  to be able to trap a <CTRL/C>.
        TELNET needs the capability to perform properly.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  This error message occurs if you try to
        run  TELNET  in  a  batch job.  Contact the system people at your
        site if this occurs and you are not using batch or have not given
        the SET NO CONTROL-C command to the EXEC.  Also, make sure not to
        run TELNET in batch.

   ?Not implemented with this protocol

        The  command  the  user  gave  is  meaningless  on  the   current
        connection  because  the  current  protocol  doesn't support that
        function.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Use a command that  is  implemented  by
        the protocol to which you are connected.

   ?No such host name-...more details...

        TELNET was expecting a host specification, but  the  input  given
        could not be interpreted.  Possibly a host name was misspelled.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Correct the error and try  the  command
        again.

   ?TAKE command in progress

        A command file run by the TAKE command tried to  execute  another
        TAKE.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Remove the second  and  any  additional
        TAKE commands from the TAKE file.

        TELNET spent more than 30 seconds trying to do a  single  network
        output  operation.  TELNET assumes that the host at the other end
        is hung and aborts the connection.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Contact the system people at your  site
        or the remote site if this problem occurs repeatedly.

   Trying...

        The user gave a CONNECT command, and TELNET is attempting to open
        the  connection.   TELNET  reports  the  result of the connection
        attempt with one of the following messages:

         o  Host dead...more details...- The remote host is not available
            at the present time.  If TELNET can get any details about the
            unavailability, it will report them.  This may  include  such
            things  as  a  message left by the remote host before it went
            down detailing why it went down and when it is expected to be
            up again.

         o  Insufficient system  resources-  TOPS-20  network  connection
            tables are full; there is no room for a new connection.

         o  Open- TELNET has succeeded in opening  a  connection  to  the
            remote  host.   The next output on the terminal will probably
            be some greeting message from the remote host.

         o  Refused- The remote host is  up,  but  it  is  not  accepting
            connections  at  the present time.  This condition is usually
            temporary; for example, the host might be momentarily  unable
            to accept the connection.  Some hosts refuse connections when
            they  are  down  for  system  work.    TACs   always   refuse
            connections if you try to TELNET to them.

   ?Undefined error

        A  system  call  returned  an  error  number  that  is   not   in
        SYSTEM:ERRMES.BIN.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Contact the system people at your site.

   ?Unrecognized command-...more details...

        TELNET was expecting a command or  host  specification,  but  the
        input  given  could  not  be  interpreted  as either.  Possibly a
        command or host name was misspelled.

        SUGGESTED USER RESPONSE:  Correct the error in the  command  line
        and retry the command.

   3.1  INTRODUCTION   3.1  INTRODUCTION

   The ARPANET File Transfer Program (FTP) is a TOPS-20 function-oriented
   protocol  that  is  used  to  transfer  files  between  ARPANET hosts.
   Through controls and specifications, the FTP  protocol  establishes  a
   common ground for file exchange and manipulation.

   The FTP  protocol  uses  the  Transmission  Control  Protocol/Internet
   Protocol  (TCP/IP)  to  establish a connection.  This connection sends
   FTP commands from the  User-FTP  to  the  Server-FTP,  and  sends  FTP
   replies  from the Server-FTP to the User-FTP.  The Server program also
   establishes a  data  connection  for  transferring  data.   Thus,  two
   connections are required:  one connection for commands and replies and
   one connection for transferring data.  The data  connection,  however,
   is transparent to the user.

   The FTP protocol is implemented by two programs:  a User program and a
   Server  program.   At  the  local  host,  you  interface  with the FTP
   protocol through the User-FTP program.  At the remote  host,  you  are
   dependent on the Server-FTP program.

   The following diagram illustrates a user request for  a  file  at  the
   remote site using the FTP protocol.



   3.2  USING FTP   3.2  USING FTP

   The User-FTP commands are the commands that you use at your  terminal.
   These  FTP protocol commands handle communication between processes on
   different hosts.  For this reason, FTP is more  transparent  and  less
   user  interactive,  and  has  more  restrictions placed on the way the
   program implements the protocol.

   The recognition feature of TOPS-20 is  not  implemented  for  all  FTP

   letters to make a command unique, the bell sounds  if  recognition  is

   The FTP protocol may initiate transparent  Host-to-Host  interactions,
   such   as  establishing  or  refusing  connections,  on  your  behalf.
   Normally, you  do  not  need  to  know  that  these  transactions  are
   occurring.   If you need to act, you receive a message indicating what
   action you should take.

   User-FTP commands can be classified into four categories:

         o  Controlling access to remote hosts

         o  Requesting a data transfer or remote file system service

         o  Controlling User-FTP locally

         o  Specifying data transfer parameters

   Sections 3.3 through 3.6 of this manual describe these four categories
   and the commands that implement the program.



   3.3  RUNNING FTP   3.3  RUNNING FTP

   To gain access to the FTP program, type FTP in response to the TOPS-20
   Exec  prompt.   You  are  then  prompted  with an asterisk (*).  The *
   indicates that the FTP program is ready to accept commands.

   To access a remote site and to  request  data  transfers  between  two
   sites, you must also connect to the site and log in at the site.

   The two commands used to perform these functions are:

         o  Connect

         o  Login


   _______ _______   CONNECT COMMAND

   The CONNECT command establishes the connection  to  the  remote  site.
   The CONNECT command takes the form:

        CONNECT (to host)<host-name>
                  or <decimal-byte>.<decimal-byte>.<decimal-byte>.
                     <decimal-byte>


                                    3-2
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


                  or  <octal-number>

   where host-name is  the  official  host  name  or  the  official  host
   nickname,  decimal-byte  refers  to a four-decimal octet INTERNET host
   number, and octal-number refers to the host's octal number.

   The following example shows a completed FTP CONNECT command.

        *CONNECT (to host) DEC-MARLBORO <RET>

   It is recommended  that  you  use  the  official  host  name  or  host
   nickname.   If the host name or nickname is used, the User-FTP program
   refers  to  a  table  of  Server  characteristics  to  establish   the
   connection.   The  connection  parameters selected from this table are
   specific and efficient.  If you use the host number, the User-FTP uses
   whatever  parameters  were last used for a connection.  Therefore, you
   may need to specify options.

   If the CONNECT command is successful, you receive a message indicating
   that  the connection has been established between the local and remote
   sites.  This message is followed by the herald of the remote host.

   The following example shows a CONNECT command followed by the response
   of the remote host.

        @FTP
         *CONNECT (to host) DEC-MARLBORO <RET>
          Connection opened
          Assuming 36-bit connections, Paged transfers
         *<DEC-MARLBORO FTP Server Process 5T(4)-7 at Thu 3-Mar-83 
            08:55-EST
         *

   Once the connection has been established, you  are  dependent  on  the
   Server-FTP  conventions.   Since  parameters  may  vary widely between
   ARPANET hosts, you may have to use the *VERBOSE and *QUOTE commands to
   help  you  at  first.   (These commands are discussed in Section 3.5.)
   This should not normally be required.

   If your FTP connection is not successful, you receive a  message  from
   the  remote  host  indicating  the  reason.  You can either follow the
   action indicated by the message for  that  remote  host,  or  you  can
   attempt a connection to another FTP host.


   _____ _______   LOGIN COMMAND

   Having established a connection to a remote host, many  sites  require
   that  you  log in at the remote host before attempting to accomplish a
   data transfer.  The LOGIN command performs this function.

   The LOGIN command takes the form:


                                    3-3
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


        *LOGIN (user-ident) username (password)password (account)account

   where user-ident or username is the name assigned for  your  login  at
   the remote host, password is the password required by the remote host,
   and account is the account required by the remote host.

   Since you are dependent on the requirements of the remote host  during
   login  at  the remote site, you must know the requirements of the host
   you are attempting to log in to.  All three  arguments  to  the  LOGIN
   command  may  not be required, or they may be different arguments from
   those required for login at the  local  host.   For  example,  TOPS-10
   systems  require  project number and programmer number in the [n,m] as
   the username parameter.  Some  hosts  require  a  previously  assigned
   account  number  or  string;  some ignore the account parameter.  Most
   remote hosts, however, do require that  the  LOGIN  command  be  given
   immediately after a successful connection.

                                              _______ ________  ________   Documentation on login is available in the ARPANET Resource  Handbook.

   a list of liaison officers.

   An example of a LOGIN command is given below.

        *LOGIN (user-ident) CPERLMAN (password)  (account)341 <RET>
        *<User CPERLMAN logged in at Thu 3-Mar-83 08:57-EST, job 13

   3.4  EXITING FTP   3.4  EXITING FTP

   Three FTP Commands that are used to terminate an FTP connection are:

         o  BYE

         o  DISCONNECT

         o  QUIT OR EXIT

   These commands determine whether your  FTP  connection  is  closed  or
   maintained while you return to the local host.


   ___ _______   BYE COMMAND

   The BYE command terminates your access to the remote host  and  closes
   your  connection  to the remote site.  The BYE command for the TOPS-20
   FTP program  logs  out  your  job  at  the  remote  host,  closes  the
   connection, and returns you to FTP command level.

   The BYE command takes the form:


                                    3-4
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


        BYE closes connection

   There is no argument after the command.  Once the BYE command has been
   executed,  you  receive  a  message indicating that the connection has
   been terminated as in:

        *BYE <RET>
        *<QUIT command received.  Goodbye
        *
        -- Connection has terminated --
        *

                                      NOTE

                If you give  a  second  CONNECT  command  without
                executing   a  BYE  command,  FTP  responds  with
                "closing  first  connection"   before   the   new
                connection is opened.  Only one connection can be
                active at any one time.

   __________ _______   DISCONNECT COMMAND

   The DISCONNECT commands aborts the connection to the remote host.  The
   DISCONNECT command takes the form:

        DISCONNECT from remote host (abort) <RET>

   where a carriage return is used to confirm the command.  Following the
   execution  of this command, you receive a message from the remote host
   indicating  that  the  connection  has  been  aborted.    A   complete
   DISCONNECT command, therefore, appears as:

        *DISCONNECT <RET>
        <QUIT command received. Goodbye.
        --Connection has terminated.--
        @


   ____ ___ ____ ________   EXIT AND QUIT COMMANDS

   The EXIT and QUIT commands allow you to return  to  the  TOPS-20  Exec
   level  without  terminating the connection to the remote host.  To use
   the EXIT and QUIT commands, type either EXIT or QUIT  in  response  to
   the  FTP  prompt.   After  you  type  a carriage return, you receive a
   message indicating that the connection is still open, followed by  the
   TOPS-20 prompt (@).  You can then perform a task at the local host and
   type CONTINUE to return to the FTP program.  An example of a completed
   EXIT command follows.  The QUIT command takes the same format.

        *EXIT <RET>
        [The connection is still open.]
        @

   3.5  GETTING HELP WITH FTP   3.5  GETTING HELP WITH FTP

   T   The User-FTP program has a HELP command available to help you use FTP.
   The  HELP  command  types information on commands, gives an example of
   FTP usage, or types current status, according to your response to  the
   HELP  command.   To use the HELP command, type HELP in response to the
   FTP * prompt.  You are then prompted with:

        *HELP <RET>
        C, E, S or ?

   Your response to this prompt dictates what type of  help  you  receive
   from the FTP program.

   If you type C in response to the HELP command you are given a list  of
   available  FTP commands.  The following example shows the use of the C
   response to the *HELP command:

        *HELP <RET>
         C, E, S or ? C <RET>
         commands are:
        CONNECT to <host-name>
                   or
        <decimal-byte>.<decimal-byte>.<decimal-byte>.<decimal-byte>

   If you type E in response to the FTP HELP command, you  are  given  an
   example of what an FTP connection is:

        *HELP
        C, E, S or ? E <RET>
        @FTP                               ;call in the subsystem

        *QUIT
        @  

   If you type the S response  to  the  HELP  command,  you  receive  the
   current status of connections, as follows:

        *HELP
        C, E, S or ? S <RET>
        DEC-MARLBORO FTP User Process 5T(13)-7
        The current data transfer parameters are:
             MODE S
             STRU P
             TYPE L 36
        NORETAIN generations
        A connection is open to host DEC-MARLBORO
        The data connection is closed.

   If you type the ?  in response to the  HELP  command,  you  receive  a
   message  indicating  which  of  the  responses you should make to this

        *HELP <RET>
        C, E, S or ? ? <RET>
        Type "C" for a list of commands, "E" for an example of FTP use,
        or "S" for current status.
        C, E, S or ?
        ? Type "HELP<RETURN>" for help.

   Three other FTP commands are useful  in  getting  help  in  using  the
   User-FTP  program.  These commands, VERBOSE, BRIEF, and QUOTE, provide
   more information on user  input  required  to  accomplish  FTP  tasks.
   These commands are discussed below.


   _______ _______   VERBOSE COMMAND

   The VERBOSE command causes additional  informational  messages  to  be
   displayed  on  your  terminal.   These  messages,  which  are  usually
   transparent during your FTP session, are  the  User-FTP  commands  and
   Server-FTP    replies.    Included   in   these   messages   are   the
   response-coding numbers.  The FTP response-coding system is  discussed
   in Section 3.7.1.  The VERBOSE command takes the form:

        VERBOSE <RET>

   where a carriage return is used to confirm  the  command.   Once  this
   command  is  executed,  you  receive  additional  information  at your
   terminal.

   The VERBOSE command is typed prior to the command for which additional
   information  is  required.   The command is especially useful when you
   are unfamiliar with a command that you want to use.  It is also useful
   when attempting a connection to a remote host whose procedures you are
   unfamiliar with.  In this case, type VERBOSE prior  to  attempting  to
   log in to the host.

   An example of the VERBOSE command follows:

        *VERBOSE <RET>
        *CONNECT (to host) DEC-MARLBORO <RET>
         Connection opened.
         Assuming 36-bit connections, Paged transfers.
        *<220 DEC-MARLBORO FTP Server Process 5T(4)-7 at Thu 3-Mar-83

   _____ _______   BRIEF COMMAND


                                    3-8
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   The BRIEF command, which is  the  FTP  default,  cancels  the  VERBOSE
   command.   There  is  no  argument  for  this  command.  Once you have
   received the information you  require  through  the  VERBOSE  command,
   typing  BRIEF  cancels  the display of the additional information.  To
   use the BRIEF command, type:

        *BRIEF <RET>

   where the carriage return is used to confirm the command.


   _____ _______   QUOTE COMMAND

   The QUOTE command is used to send information to the remote host  with
   no  translation  by the FTP program.  The text is sent directly to the
   Server.  To use the QUOTE command, type QUOTE  followed  by  a  space,
   followed  by whatever information you wish the remote host to receive.
   When you press the carriage return, this information is  sent  exactly
   and  directly to the remote host.  The FTP protocol does not interpret
   this information.

   In the following example, a user has requested a  new  password  using
   the  CWD  command.   (See  Section 3.6.1 for a discussion of CWD.) The
   user wants to send this password directly to  the  remote  host.   The
   command, therefore, appears as:

        *QUOTE PASS DEC-20 <RET>

   The QUOTE command causes the string "pass DEC-20" to be sent  directly
   to the remote host.



   3.6  FTP COMMANDS   3.6  FTP COMMANDS

   The following sections discuss the FTP commands used to:  request data
   transfers  or  remote  file system service, get local information, and
   specify the data transfer parameters.



   3.6.1  Requesting Data Transfers or Remote File System Service   3.6.1  Requesting Data Transfers or Remote File System Service

   Some FTP commands are used to request a service from the remote  host.
   Included  are  commands  that  request files to be moved, deleted, and
   renamed.  The requests that are made  must  conform  to  the  User-FTP
   requirements.   If defaults are allowed, they are Server defaults.  If
   a name is used for a device or file presently located or to be located
   at   the   remote   site,  the  name  follows  the  Server-FTP  naming
   conventions.

   You cannot give any commands during a file transfer.   You  must  wait


                                    3-9
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   for  the  *  prompt  following the transfer complete message.  You can
   type <CTRL/G>, however, if you want to abort the transfer.

                                    NOTE

           Some  Servers  are  able  to   monitor   the   command
           connection  (commands  and  responses)  and  the  data
           connection (file transfers)  simultaneously.   Consult
           your  System  Manager  before  attempting  to use this
           feature.

   The following sections discuss the FTP Service commands.


   ___ _______   GET COMMAND

   The GET Command is used to request that a copy of a file at the remote
   site  be  transferred  to  a  file at the local site.  The GET command
   takes the form:

        GET (foreign-filename) filename 1 <RET>
         to (local-file) filename 2 <RET>

   where filename 1 is the name of the remote file you are requesting and
   filename  2 is the name of the local file.  Filename 1 uses the naming
   conventions of the  remote  host,  and  filename  2  uses  the  naming
   conventions  of the local host.  It is recommended that you always use
   a complete file specification for the local file.

   If you do not type a directory name  preceding  either  file  name,  a
   default  is  used.   For the remote file, the default directory is the
   FTP-login directory.  Or, if a CWD (Change Working Directory)  command
   has  been  given (see discussion of CWD below), the directory named in
   the CWD command is the default.   For  the  local  file,  the  default
   directory is your current connected directory.  If you press the <ESC>
   key for the local file, the exact name string used in the remote  file
   name is used for the local file name.

   When a GET command has been executed, you receive a message indicating
   that the transfer has begun.  A second message appears indicating that
   the transfer has been completed.  If the transfer cannot be completed,
   you   receive   a   message  indicating  this.   You  can  follow  the
   instructions in this message to correct the problem and  then  reissue
   the *GET command.

   The following example shows a completed GET command:

        *GET (foreign-filename) TELNET.LOG.3 <RET>
             (To local-file)TELNET.LOG.3 <RET>
        <PAGED retrieve of <CPERLMAN> TELNET.LOG.3 started
        <Transfer completed.

   ____ _______   SEND COMMAND

   The SEND command is used to transfer a copy of a file from  the  local
   host to the remote host.  The SEND command takes the form:

        SEND (local-file) filename1 <RET>
             (to remote-file) filename2 <RET>

   where filename 1 is the name of the local file, and filename 2 is  the
   name of the remote file.

   The same naming conventions  and  messages  that  apply  to  the  SEND
   command apply to the GET command.

   An example of the SEND command follows:

        *SEND (local-file) TELNET.LOG.5 <RET>
              (to remote-file)TELNET.LOG.5 <RET>
        <Paged store of <CPERLMAN> TELNET.LOG.5; P777700; A341 started.
        <Transfer completed.
        *


   ________ ________ ________   MULTIPLE GET/SEND COMMANDS

   TOPS-20  ARPANET  sites  allow  MULTIPLE  GET/SEND  commands.    These
   commands  allow  the  use  of  the  TOPS-20  wildcard  feature for the
   transfer of multiple files either to or from a remote host.

   The MULTIPLE GET/SEND commands take the form:

        MULTIPLE GET (remote-file group) group filename 
          or extension <RET>
                  or
        MULTIPLE SEND (local-file group) group filename 
          or extension <RET>

   where in either command a wildcard can be used for the file  names  or
   the extensions, as in:

        *MULTIPLE GET (remote-file group) FTP.* <RET>
                  or
        *MULTIPLE SEND (local-file group) *.MEM <RET>

   All other naming conventions and defaults that apply to  the  GET  and
   SEND commands apply to the MULTIPLE GET/SEND commands.

   An example of a MULTIPLE GET command follows:

        *MULTIPLE GET (remote-file group) *.MEM <RET>
        <List started.
        <Transfer completed.

   ______ _______   RENAME COMMAND

   The RENAME command is used to rename a file at the remote  host.   The
   RENAME command takes the form:

        RENAME (existing-file) filename 1 <RET>
                 (to be) remote-filename <RET>

   where filename 1 is the current name of the  remote  file  and  remote
   filename  is  the new file name for the file.  File-naming conventions
   follow the requirements of the remote host.

   An example of the RENAME command follows:

        *RENAME (existing-file) ARPA.MEM.4 <RET>
                 (to be) ARPA.TXT.1 <RET>
        <Old file renamed <CPERLMAN> ARPA.TXT.1
        *


   ______ _______   DELETE COMMAND

   The DELETE command is used to delete files at the  remote  host.   The
   command takes the form:

        DELETE (foreign file) filename <RET>

   where filename is the name of the file you want to have deleted.

   When you have issued a DELETE command, you are asked whether  this  is
   the  file  you want to delete.  This is done to insure that you do not
   delete the wrong file.  If you make a mistake in typing the file name,
   you  can  edit the file name before pressing the <RET> key.  If you do
   not want to delete the file, answer N in response to the message.  You
   then see the FTP prompt.

   An example of the DELETE command follows:

        *DELETE (foreign file) FTP.LOG.2 <RET>
        Do you really want to delete FTP.LOG.2 (Y or N)? Y <RET>
        *<Lowest generation deleted ok, file <CPERLMAN> FTP.LOG.2
        *

   ___ _______   CWD COMMAND

   The CWD (Change Working Directory) command is used  either  to  change
   your default directory at the remote site or to connect to a different
   directory at the remote site.  This command is similar  to  a  TOPS-20
   Connect  command.  Access to a different directory for file storage or
   retrieval at the remote site  is  possible  with  this  command.   The
   command takes the form:

        CWD (to directory) directory name <RET>

   where directory name is the name to be given to the working  directory
   or the name of the directory you want to access.

   This command saves the overhead of repeating the log-in and accounting
   information.   Transfer parameters remain as originally selected.  The
   name given for the directory follows  the  convention  of  the  remote
   host.   Also,  the remote host may require that you type a password or
   account at this time.  The TOPS-20 Server-FTP  program  requires  that
   you  give a password if you are required to give a password when doing
   a connect to the named directory.

   An example of the CWD command follows:

        *CWD PS:<PAETZOLD> <RET>
        *<250 Connected to PS:<PAETZOLD>.

                                    NOTE

           TOPS-20  directory  format  is   STRUCTURE:<DIRECTORY>
           where  STRUCTURE,  if  not  specified, defaults to the
           current connected structure and  <DIRECTORY>,  if  not
           specified,   defaults   to   the   current   connected
           directory.

           TENEX and several  other  operating  systems  use  the
           format USERNAME or username for directory.

   _________ _______   DIRECTORY COMMAND

   The DIRECTORY command is used to request that a listing of  the  names
   of  the files in the named directory at the remote host be sent to the
   local host.  The DIRECTORY command takes the form:

        DIRECTORY (of remote user) DIRECTORY NAME <RET>
         to local file: filename or TTY: <RET>

   where DIRECTORY NAME is the name of  the  remote  directory  you  want
   listed,  filename  is  the name of the local file you want to have the
   directory placed in, and TTY:  is used to have the directory output to
   your terminal.



                                    3-13
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   You must type TTY:  if you want output to your terminal.   File-naming
   conventions  follow  the  local  host requirements if you want to have
   output placed in a file.  If you do not type  a  directory  name,  the
   default argument is your current connected directory.

   You receive a message indicating that the transfer has been completed.

   An example of the DIRECTORY command follows:

        *DIRECTORY of <CROSSLAND> <RET>
        to local-file: TTY: <RET>
        <List started.
        PS:<CROSSLAND>
        CHING.MAC.4
        DUMMY.1
        MAIL.TXT.1
        TEMP.FIL.1
        <Transfer completed.
        *


   ______ _______   STATUS COMMAND

   The STATUS command is used to request information about the parameters
   of  your  current  connection  to the remote host.  The STATUS command
   takes the form:

        STATUS (of server) <RET>

   where a carriage return <RET> is used to  confirm  the  command.   You
   then  receive  a  message  that  shows the current parameters for your
   connection, as follows:

        *STATUS <RET>
        DEC-MARLBORO FTP User Process 5T(13)-7
        The current data transfer parameters are:
             MODE S
             STRU P
             TYPE L 36
        NORETAIN generations
        A connection is open to host DEC-MARLBORO
        The data connection is closed.
        *


   _______ _______   ACCOUNT COMMAND

   The ACCOUNT command takes the form of:

        ACCOUNT <number> or <string> <RET>

   The ACCOUNT command accepts  either  a  number  or  a  string  as  the


                                    3-14
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   argument  identifying  the  user's  account  at the remote site.  This
   command is not necessarily related to the  account  parameter  in  the
   LOGIN  command.  Some hosts require that an account be given to access
   specific files, or to manipulate files in a specific way.  The ACCOUNT
   command is provided to satisfy this requirement.


   ______ _______   RETAIN COMMAND

   The RETAIN command causes the  generation  number  of  a  file  to  be
   transferred either to or from a remote host.  The generation number of
   the file is not changed by the FTP protocol during transmission.   The
   RETAIN command takes the form:

        RETAIN <RET>

   where a carriage return is used to confirm  the  command.   Once  this
   command  is  executed, generation numbers are sent/received exactly as
   they appear in the name string.


   ________ _______   NORETAIN COMMAND

   The NORETAIN command, which is the system default, cancels the  RETAIN
   command.  This command takes the form:

        NORETAIN <RET>

   where a carriage return is used to  confirm  the  command.   Once  the
   NORETAIN  command  is executed, generation numbers of files can change
   during transmission.  Therefore, if there is a  file  being  requested
   that has a generation number of 4 and there is no existing file at the
   receiving site, the file will have a generation number of 1 when it is
   received, as follows:

        *GET (foreign-filename) TELNET.TXT.4 <RET>
             (to local-file) <ESC> TELNET.TXT.1 <RET>

   If the NORETAIN command is executed,  you  must  type  the  generation
   number if you want to have the generation number retained.



   3.6.2  FTP Information Commands   3.6.2  FTP Information Commands

   In addition to the VERBOSE and QUOTE  commands  already  discussed  in
   Section  2.5,  another  command,  the  STATISTICS  command,  is passed
   directly to the program.  Neither the command connection nor the  data
   connection  are  involved.   All  communication is accomplished at the
   local site.

   ______________ _______   [NO]STATISTICS COMMAND

   The STATISTICS command and its counterpart, the NOSTATISTICS  command,
   are  used  to  control the terminal display of statistical information
   about a transfer.  The information you receive displays statistics  on
   file transfer rate, bits sent, and time consumed during data transfer.
   This information  is  displayed  after  the  data  transfer  has  been
   completed.

   The STATISTICS command takes the form:

        STATISTICS <RET>

   where a carriage return <RET> is used to confirm the  command.   There
   is  no  argument  to  the  command.   The  STATISTICS command is typed
   immediately prior to the command for  which  you  are  requesting  the
   statistical information.

   An example of the STATISTICS command follows:

        *STATISTICS <RET>
        *GET (foreign-filename) TELNET.LOG.2 <RET>
             (to local-file) TELNET.LOG <RET>
        <Paged retrieve of <CPERLMAN> TELNET.LOG.5 started.
        <Transfer completed.


        137. bytes transferred, run time = 96. MS,
        Elapsed time =3080. MS, Rate =1601. Baud
        *

   The NOSTATISTICS command cancels the STATISTICS command.  There are no
   arguments  to  the  NOSTATISTICS command.  The NOSTATISTICS command is
   the system default.  Therefore, the NOSTATISTICS command is only  used
   if you want to cancel a STATISTICS command.

   The NOSTATISTICS command takes the form:

        NOSTATISTICS <RET>

   where a carriage return is used to confirm the command.



   3.6.3  Controlling FTP Transfer Parameters   3.6.3  Controlling FTP Transfer Parameters

   FTP transfer parameters specify how bits are transmitted and  how  the
   data  is represented.  You seldom need to use these parameter commands
   since the User-FTP protocol selects those parameters that provide  the
   best  fit  for  a  connection before attempting a connection.  This is
   done transparently.   All  but  a  few  hosts  accept  the  parameters
   selected by the program.


                                    3-16
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   If you give a data transfer parameter command that  is  known  by  the
   program to be "unsuitable," the command is ignored.  If you are trying
   to receive service from a host and the host  is  either  unwilling  or
   unable  to  accept  the  existing data transfer parameters, the remote
   host generally sends you a message indicating that  the  parameter  is
   not  supported.   If this happens, it is recommended that you try some
   other combination of parameter values.  If it is  important  that  you
   receive  some  service  from  that particular host, contact the System
   Manager or the liaison contact for that site.

                                  WARNING

           If  you  need  to  use  the  FTP  transfer   parameter
           commands,  contact  a  system person at your site.  Do
           not attempt to use  these  commands  if  you  are  not
           experienced with them.

   All  hosts  in  the  FTP  program  must  accept  a  set  of   "minimum
   implementation"  values  for data transfer parameters.  All FTP hosts,
   therefore, accept the following values as standard defaults:

        TYPE:  ASCII NONPRINT
        BYTE:  8 bits
        MODE:  STREAM
        STRU:  FILE

   These four default values are implemented in the TOPS-20 FTP programs.
   The  default  values  are assumed unless the user or, more frequently,
   the User-FTP program gives  a  command  with  different  values.   The
   transfer values set are normally reported in a message.

   The data transfer commands  supported  by  the  User-FTP  program  are
   discussed below.


   ____ _______   TYPE COMMAND

   The TYPE command specifies the  data  representation  type.   Possible
   arguments are A, I, and L.  The TYPE command takes the form:

        TYPE (key letter) letter (decimal) number <RET>

   where key letter can be A, I, or L and number is 8, 32, or 36.

   TYPE  A  specifies  NVT-ASCII,  that   is   a   7-bit   ASCII   string
   right-justified  in  an 8-bit byte with no vertical format information
   for printing.  TYPE I (Image)  specifies  contiguous  bits  that,  for
   transfer,  are  packed  into  bytes  of the size specified in the BYTE
   command.  Type L (Long) specifies a logical byte size.  Theoretically,
   the  logical  byte  size  and  the data transfer byte size may differ.
   Because of the restrictions described, and because the  byte  size  is
   taken  from the BYTE command (explicit or implied), the TYPE L command

   is seldom used.

   An example of the TYPE command follows:

        TYPE (key letter) L (decimal) 36 <RET>


   _________ _______   STRUCTURE COMMAND

   The STRUCTURE command specifies the file structure to  be  used.   FTP
   currently  recognizes file structure and paged structure.  The TOPS-20
   user-FTP program selects a default structure  based  on  the  type  of
   operating  system at the remote site.  If the remote site is listed as
   TOPS-20, TOPS-10, or TENEX, PAGED structure is used  as  the  default.
   Other systems use FILE structure as the default.

   The STRUCTURE command takes the form:

        STRUCTURE (key letter) letter <RET>

   where letter is either P for page structure, F for file structure,  or
   R for record structure.

   An example of the STRUCTURE command follows:

        *STRUCTURE (key letter) F <RET>


   ____ _______   MODE COMMAND

   Only the stream transfer mode is supported by TOPS-20.   This  is  the
   default  mode.   If the MODE command is given, the argument must be S.
   The  FTP  protocol  also  recognizes   block   and   compressed   mode
   (represented  as  B  and  C,  respectively).   B  and  C modes are not
   supported by TOPS-20.  Since  all  FTP  implementations  must  support
   stream mode, there should be no problem.

   The MODE command takes the form:

        MODE (key letter) letter <RET>

   where the letter for TOPS-20 is S.  An example  of  a  completed  MODE
   command follows:

        *MODE (key letter) S <RET>



   3.7  RESPONSE CODES AND MESSAGES   3.7  RESPONSE CODES AND MESSAGES

   The FTP protocol specifies that  each  command  received  by  the  FTP
   Server  generate  at least one reply.  Thus, the User process is aware


                                    3-18
                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM                         THE FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM


   of the current state of the Server whether the command  is  successful
   or   unsuccessful.   There  is  currently  one  exception.   Before  a
   connection is made, any error in the CONNECT command itself results in
   the ?  response rather than a meaningful message.  Once the connection
   is established, you generally receive sufficient response to  commands
   to permit you to continue.

   A 3-digit numbering system is followed for all response codes.   These
   codes are for the User-FTP program and are interpreted by the program.
   The program may or may not verbalize the implied content of  the  code
   and  display  it  for the user.  If you use the VERBOSE command, reply
   codes with explanatory verbal messages are displayed on your terminal.
   Use  of the VERBOSE command is recommended whenever you are engaged in
   unfamiliar tasks or are connecting to a host  whose  operating  system
   you are not familiar with.

   Command responses that appear on your terminal may originate in either
   the  User-  or  Server-FTP  program.   Messages  from  the  server are
   preceded by a left angle bracket (<).  The  content  of  responses  is
   specified,  but the specific wording is left to the implementing site.
   Because you may be connecting to many different  Servers,  it  is  not
   possible  to list all possible responses.  There are varying texts for
   the same reply code.

   Server-FTP responses may sometimes appear on your terminal  while  you
   are  typing  commands to the User-FTP.  The * prompt may appear before
   the response to the previous command.

   If you have any problems with coded responses from a  Server,  contact
                                                                  _______   the  liaison  person  at  the  Server  site.   See the current ARPANET
   ________ ________   RESOURCE HANDBOOK for both a list of liaison contact and  instructions
   on  getting an up-to-date list by means of the ARPANET.  Such problems
   as replies not clearly worded, replies that do not appear  appropriate
   in  the  context  of  the  existing connection, or negative completion
   replies  that  you  cannot  understand  should  be  reported  to   the
   appropriate Server site.



   3.7.1  Response-Coding System   3.7.1  Response-Coding System

   The major category of the response code  is  specified  by  the  first
   digit.  This digit indicates the general acceptability of the command.
   The second digit distinguishes the first digit by  function,  and  the
   third digit distinguishes the second.

   The first digit indicates acceptability as follows:

             This reply encourages you to try again.   Your  command  was
             received  and  no action was taken.  The error condition can
             be corrected without changing the  command,  the  arguments,
             the  file  access,  or  the  username, and without requiring
             additional implementation on the part of  the  Server.   You
             are  most  likely  to  get  this  reply  code when there are
             problems not associated with errors in the commands.

             Examples:  421 Service not available closing connection.
                        This is given in reply to any  command  when  the
                        server knows the system is going down.
                        452 Requested  action  not  taken:   insufficient

             A command was given but it was not  acceptable.   No  action
             was  taken.   A  reply  with  5  as  the  first digit always
             indicates an error.  The user must decide  from  the  verbal
             message  what  action should be taken.  Read the message and
             then examine the command  that  caused  the  message  to  be
             given.   Perhaps  a  change in spelling or in your connected
             directory is in order.  Perhaps the remote system is using a
             file  you  have  requested.   If  so,  give the BYE and QUIT
             commands and return later.  However, if the  verbal  message

             indicates  the command is not implemented, no further action
             is possible.

             Examples:  501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments.
                        502 Command not implemented.
                        550 Requested action not taken: file unavailable.

   The second digit is based on a functional classification as follows:

        n0n Syntax, including syntax errors or unnecessary commands

        n1n Information

        n2n Connections

        n3n Authentication (logon) and Accounting

        n4n Reserved

        n5n File system

   The third digit further defines the meaning  assigned  in  the  second
   digit.   Hosts  adding to or implementing an FTP program are requested
   to adapt the verbal expression for a reply code if an already  similar
   3-digit code exists.  An example of the function of the third digit is
   found in  the  21n  series.   All  four  replies  below  are  positive
   completion;  all  are  information replies.  The third digit indicates
   the type of information.

   4.1  INTRODUCTION   4.1  INTRODUCTION

   TSTATS  is  an  ARPANET  utility  that  provides   information   about
   connections   between   hosts.    TSTATS   gives   you  the  following
   information:

         o  The existing connections

         o  The state of the connections

         o  The number of bytes of data you can send to a receiving host



   4.2  RUNNING TSTATS   4.2  RUNNING TSTATS

   To run TSTATS, type TSTATS in response to the command level prompt, as
   in the following example:

        @TSTATS <RET>

   When you press carriage  return,  a  statistical  listing  of  ARPANET
   connections is displayed on your terminal.

   The following example shows the information displayed in  response  to
   the TSTATS command.

   Once this information is displayed on your terminal, you are  returned
   to  command  level.   The  TSTATS  utility  has  no  other commands or
   arguments.



   4.3  INTERPRETING TSTATS   4.3  INTERPRETING TSTATS

   This section discusses the information displayed by TSTATS.


   ___ _______ ___   JOB NUMBER, JFN

   The first column in TSTATS lists the job number for your job  and  the
   job file number (JFN) within the job.  In the example presented above,
   the numbers 1,2 under JFN represent job number 1 and job  file  number
   2.


   _____   STATE

   The second column in TSTATS lists the state of the connection for  the
   local  port  and  the foreign port.  The first code word indicates the
   state of the local port.  The second code word indicates the state  of
   the  foreign  port.  The code words that are printed are states caused
   by the TSTATS protocol.  The  letters,  called  flags,  represent  the
   states  caused  by  what  the user requests.  Both words and flags are
   displayed in the STATE column.

   Connections can be in one of the following states:

        CODE      MEANING

        EST       Established
        PND       Pending
        SYN       Opened by one host
        FIN       Closed by one host
        NOT       Closed by both host
        O         Connection open
        P         Push (to send information)
        A         Connection aborted
        V         Send sequence number is valid
        U         Urgent data to be received

   An established connection (EST) is an active  connection  between  two
   hosts.   A pending connection (PND) exists when one host has requested
   a connection (SYN) and is waiting  for  the  other  host  to  indicate
   whether  or  not  the  host  will  accept  the  connection.   A closed
   connection (NOT) exists when both hosts have closed the connection.  A
   NOT  connection may also exist when a local host has never established
   a connection and is  open  or  listening  for  a  connection.   A  FIN
   connection  exists  when  one  host  has  closed the connection and is


                                    4-2
                                   TSTATS                                   TSTATS


   waiting for the other host to close the connection.

   An O flag is displayed when an active connection exists.  A  P  (PUSH)
   flag  is  displayed  when  the user has issued a command that requires
   immediate  delivery  of  data.   An  A  flag  is  displayed  when  the
   connection  has  been  aborted.   A  V flag is displayed when the send
   sequence number (see discussion of sequence number below) is valid.  A
   U  flag  is displayed when there is a high-priority message, such as a
   TELNET control message, to be sent to the local host.   This  priority
   message takes precedence over all other data.

   In the following example of a STATE column, both hosts are waiting for
   the  connection to be closed.  The FIN.FIN indicates this.  The P flag
   indicates that data has been sent and is guaranteed delivery.

            STATE
        FIN.FIN.--P----


   _____ _____ _______ ____   LOCAL PORT, FOREIGN PORT

   The third and fourth  columns  in  TSTATS  list  the  ports  that  the
   connections exist on.  TCP/IP establishes connections between hosts on
   specific ports.  Ports indicate the type of connection.  Ports may  be
   TELNET,  FTP,  or  mail.   (For  a  detailed  discussion of ports, see
   Chapter 2, TELNET.) The third column of TSTATS lists  the  local  port
   (LP) or the connection on the local host side.

   In the following example, a TELNET connection  exists  for  the  local
   port.  This is indicated by the number 23.

        LPORT
           23

   The fourth column of  TSTATS  lists  the  foreign  port  (FP)  or  the
   connection  on  the  foreign side.  The ports for the foreign port are
   given as decimal numbers.

   The most common ports are:

        Port 21    FTP
        Port 23    TELNET
        Port 25    Mail

   A port designated as  0  indicates  that  a  host  is  waiting  for  a
   connection.


   _______ ____ __________   FOREIGN HOST (FGN-HOST)

   The fifth column, FGN-HOST, lists the host name for the  foreign  host
   side  of the particular connection.  Most often, this column lists the


                                    4-3
                                   TSTATS                                   TSTATS


   host name.  If the host name is unknown, the decimal octet  number  of
   the host is displayed.  If zeros (0) are displayed in the foreign host
   column, there is no connection to a foreign host.

   In the following example, the first foreign  host  has  zeros  listed.
   This  indicates  that  no connection exists.  In the second line under
   the header, the name RADC-TAC is  listed.   This  indicates  that  the
   foreign host is RADC-TAC.

        FGN-HOST
        0,0,0,0
        RADC-TAC


   _______ ________ ____________   RECEIVE SEQUENCE (R-SEQUENCE)

   The sixth column in TSTATS lists the  receive  sequence  (R-SEQUENCE).
   The  receive  sequence is the number of the next byte that the foreign
   port will receive.

   In the following example, the receive sequence is 1780306709.

        R-SEQUENCE
        1780306709


   ____ ________ ____________   SEND SEQUENCE (S-SEQUENCE)

   The seventh column in TSTATS lists  the  send  sequence  (S-SEQUENCE).
   The  send  sequence is the number of the last byte that the local host
   sent to the foreign host.

   In the following example, the send sequence is 359662611.

        S-SEQUENCE 359662611


   ____ ______ _______   SEND WINDOW (SENDW)

   The final column in TSTATS is  the  send  window  (SENDW).   The  send
   window in TSTATS is the number of bytes of data that a foreign port is
   either willing or able to receive from the local  port.   Most  often,
   the  send  window  is  determined by the buffer space available at the
   foreign host.  If the SENDW is at 0, the foreign port will not  accept
   data  transmission.   The SENDW does change as space becomes available
   or unavailable.

   In the following example, there is a send  window  of  0  and  a  send
   window  of  256.  The send window of 0 indicates that the foreign port
   is unwilling or unable  to  accept  data.   The  send  window  of  256
   indicates that the foreign port is able or willing to accept 256 bytes
   of data.

   5.1  INTRODUCTION   5.1  INTRODUCTION

   IPHOST is an ARPANET utility that:

         o  Gives information about ARPANET hosts.

         o  Converts host numbers from one format to other formats.

         o  Cycles the ARPANET up and down.



   5.2  RUNNING IPHOST   5.2  RUNNING IPHOST

   To run IPHOST, type IPHOST in response to the TOPS-20 prompt.  You are
   then  prompted  with  IPHOST followed by a right angle bracket (>), as
   in:

        @IPHOST <RET>
        IPHOST- TOPS-20AN TCP/IP Host Utility Program - Version 5.2(10)
        IPHOST>

   At this point, the IPHOST program is ready to accept commands.



   5.3  EXITING IPHOST   5.3  EXITING IPHOST

   To exit from IPHOST, type EXIT in response to the  IPHOST  prompt,  as
   in:

        IPHOST> EXIT <RET>
        @

   You are then returned to the Exec command level.




                                    5-1
                                   IPHOST                                   IPHOST


   5.4  GETTING HELP WITH IPHOST   5.4  GETTING HELP WITH IPHOST

   The two commands used to get help with IPHOST are  the  question  mark
   (?) and the HELP command.

   The question mark typed after the IPHOST prompt gives a  list  of  the
   IPHOST  commands.  The following example shows the use of the question
   mark:

        IPHOST>? one of the following:
         ARPANET    CONVERT    EXIT    HELP    LOCAL    NAME    NUMBER

   Escape can be used to help complete command strings.   In  this  case,
   type  an <ESC> following the command.  The IPHOST program then prompts
   you for the information needed to complete  the  command,  as  in  the
   following example:

        IPHOST>NAME (OF HOST IS)DEC-MARLBORO ?  confirm with carriage return

   The HELP command prints a brief  help  text  at  your  terminal.   The
   following  example  shows  the  text  printed  in response to the HELP
   command.

        IPHOST> HELP <RET>
        Command         Description

                        the name.
        NUMBER          Dump information about a specific host given 
                        the number.  The number is in the 
                        format aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd.



   5.5  IPHOST COMMANDS   5.5  IPHOST COMMANDS

   IPHOST commands fall into three categories:

         o  Commands that give information about ARPANET hosts.

         o  Commands that convert decimal, octal, and INTERNET numbers to
            other formats.

         o  Commands that cycle the ARPANET up and down.

   The following section discusses the IPHOST commands.


                                    5-2
                                   IPHOST                                   IPHOST


   ____ _______   NAME COMMAND

   The  NAME  command  gives  information  about  ARPANET   hosts.    The
   information  includes  decimal octet number, host name, status as user
   or server, and type of software.  The NAME command takes the form:

        IPHOST>NAME (OF HOST IS) host name <RET>

   where host name is either the host name or host nickname.  If you  are
   unsure  of the host name or nickname, typing a question mark after the
   NAME command displays  a  list  of  server  host  names,  server  host
   nicknames,  user  host  names, and user host nicknames.  The following
   example shows the information displayed in response  to  the  question
   mark after the NAME command:

        IPHOST>NAME (OF HOST IS) ? <RET>


        Server Host Name
        ----------------
        One of the following:

         010.001.000.079 DEC-MARLBORO, SERVER, USER, TOPS-20


   _____ _______   LOCAL COMMAND

   The LOCAL command provides the same information for the local host  as
   the  NAME  command  provides  for a specified host.  The LOCAL command
   takes the form:

        IPHOST>LOCAL (HOST INFORMATION) <RET>

   Following a carriage return, the information shown  in  the  following
   example is displayed at your terminal:

        IPHOST>LOCAL (HOST INFORMATION) <RET>
         010.001.000.079 DEC-MARLBORO, SERVER, USER, TOPS-20


   ______ _______   NUMBER COMMAND


                                    5-3
                                   IPHOST                                   IPHOST


   The NUMBER command gives the same information as the  NAME  and  LOCAL
   commands,  but you input a host decimal octet number instead of a host
   name.  The NUMBER command takes the form:

        IPHOST>NUMBER (OF HOST)DECIMAL OCTET <RET>

   where decimal number is one of the decimal  octets  for  the  INTERNET
   host  you  want  information  about.   The following example shows the
   information displayed with the NUMBER command.

        IPHOST>NUMBER (OF HOST) 10.1.0.79 <RET>
         010.001.000.079 DEC-MARLBORO, SERVER, USER, TOPS-20


   _______ _______   CONVERT COMMAND

   The CONVERT command is used to change the format of a host number from
   Internet  to  decimal or octal, from decimal to Internet or octal, and
   from octal to decimal or Internet.   The  CONVERT  command  takes  the
   form:

        IPHOST>CONVERT (A HOST NUMBER FROM)decimal,internet, octal <RET>

   where decimal, internet, and octal followed by a  number  specify  the
   address of the host you want information about.

   The following examples show the three formats of the CONVERT command:

        IPHOST>CONVERT (A HOST NUMBER FROM)INTERNET 010.001.000.079<RET>
         Internet: 010.001.000.079, Decimal: 167837775, Octal: 1200200117


        IPHOST>CONVERT (A HOST NUMBER FROM) DECIMAL 167837775 <RET>
         Internet: 010.001.000.079, Decimal: 167837775, Octal: 1200200117


        IPHOST>CONVERT (A HOST NUMBER FROM) OCTAL 1200200117 <RET>
         Internet: 010.001.000.079, Decimal: 167837775, Octal: 1200200117


   _______ _______   ARPANET COMMAND

   The ARPANET command is a privileged command that is used to cycle  the
   ARPANET  up and down.  Any one of three words is used to complete this
   command:  initialize, status, and state.  The  ARPANET  command  takes
   the form:

        IPHOST>ARPANET command word <RET>

   where command word is either initialize, status, or state.

   The ARPANET INITIALIZE command is used to reload  host  tables.   This


                                    5-4
                                   IPHOST                                   IPHOST


   command takes the form:

        IPHOST>ARPANET INITIALIZE (HOST TABLES)<RET>

   where a carriage return confirms the command.

   The ARPANET STATUS command tells you whether  the  ARPANET  is  up  or
   down.  This command takes the form:

        IPHOST>ARPANET STATUS <RET>

   where a carriage return confirms the command.  Following the execution
   of  this  command,  an  informational  message  is  displayed  at your
   terminal:

        ARPANET status is on
           or
        ARPANET status is off

   The ARPANET STATE command is used  to  bring  up  or  bring  down  the
   ARPANET.  This command takes the form:

        IPHOST>ARPANET STATE (IS) ON OFF<RET>

   where the arguments ON or OFF are used to complete the  command.   The
   ON  argument turns the ARPANET on.  The OFF argument turns the ARPANET
   off.  An example of the ARPANET STATE command  with  the  argument  ON
   follows:

        IPHOST>ARPANET STATE (IS) ON <RET>
