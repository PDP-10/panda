XX:<CHIVES.V1.DOCUMENTATION>-READ-.-THIS-.1,  9-Sep-88 01:30:44, Edit by SRA

This directory contains whatever documentation may exist for the
CHIVES system.  Mostly this is notes for those responsible for
installing and possibly modifying the CHIVES software, although there
is a manual entry for the GTDOM% JSYS call.  If somebody feels like
writing more extensive documentation, please do so and send it back to
us....
