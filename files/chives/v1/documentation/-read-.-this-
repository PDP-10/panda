This directory contains whatever documentation may exist for the
CHIVES system.  Mostly this is notes for those responsible for
installing and possibly modifying the CHIVES software, although there
is a manual entry for the GTDOM% JSYS call.  If somebody feels like
writing more extensive documentation, please do so and send it back to
us....
