XX:<CHIVES.V1.CONFIG>-READ-.-THIS-.3,  9-Sep-88 01:29:13, Edit by SRA

This directory contains configuration files for the CHIVES system.

ASSIGNED.PORTS and ASSIGNED.PROTOCOLS are machine readable extracts
from the assigned numbers document.  They are used to parse the tokens
in zone files and to write out port and protocol numbers.  In fact,
the resolver finds out the number of the reserved port for the domain
protocol by looking in this file.  These files should be updated
occasionally.  Maybe someday we can get the Number Czar to furnish
these files for us?

RESOLV.CONFIG is the configuration file for the resolver.  The usual
commenting conventions apply (ie, semicolons).  The format is a
keyword followed by function specific arguments.  The real
documentation on the defined keywords is the source code; see RESOLV.C
and INTERN.D.  As of this writing, the following keywords are defined.
Not all are implemented, those that are not are marked "(NIY)".  Most
of these have shorter aliases if you don't like typing long keywords.

	LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH		;see below (search paths)
	REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH		;see below (search paths)

	DEFAULT-NAMESERVER		;see below (safety belt)

	UDP-RETRANSMIT-INTERVAL		;how long we wait between
					;packets on a particular query
	QUERY-TIMEOUT			;max lifetime of a query
	MAX-TRIES-PER-SERVER-PER-QUERY	;max packets per server per query
	MAX-CNAMES-PER-QUERY		;how many CNAMEs we permit
					;before deciding we're looping	
	GC-PERIOD			;how long we wait between
					;passes of the garbage collector
					;that flushes expired RRs

	LOAD-ZONE			;load an authoritative zone
					;from disk
	PRELOAD-CACHE			;preload the cache from disk
					;(don't use this unless you
					; really know what you're doing)

	AUTHORIZE-USER			;authorize a user to send
					;control messages to the resolver

	MAX-REASONABLE-TTL		;biggest RR TTL we are willing
					;to believe

Most of these are just decimal numbers.  All times are in decimal
seconds.

Search paths are specified by using one or more LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH or
REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH entries.  The argument to these keywords is a
domain name to be used as a suffix when looking for names.  The list
is assembled in the order specified.  There is always an implicit
search entry of "." at the head of the LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH list; the
REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH list will always have a "."  entry (if you don't
specify one it will be the last entry in the search list).  Local
search is the process of looking for unmatched names with the
specified suffixes in the LOCAL DATABASE (ie, the locally loaded
zones).  Remote search is the same thing, but specifies suffixes that
should be tried when actually RESOLVING (querying remote nameservers)
or when using the cache.  The cache is specificly excluded from
LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH processing because otherwise results would be
non-deterministic (ie, the exact answer you get would vary depending
on what you had in your cache).

Local searching is a relatively fast process.  Remote searching can be
very expensive, since in the worst case it is essentially a series of
queries, each of which involves one or more network transactions.  For
this reason, REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH should be used with extreme caution.
If your resolver is spending a significant portion of its time
querying a small set of zones, you might want to consider keeping
local copies of the zone files (via domain zone transfer, FTP, or some
other means) and using LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH instead.

Example (see below for explaination of LOAD-ZONE command):

	; Config file for machines in the CS department
	; at Miskatonic University
	;
	; Locally loaded zones and searches
	; CS department
	LOAD-ZONE		CS.MISKATONIC.EDU.	DOMAIN:CS.ZONE
	LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH	CS.MISKATONIC.EDU.
	; AI lab
	LOAD-ZONE		AI.MISKATONIC.EDU.	DOMAIN:AI.ZONE
	LOCAL-SEARCH-PATH	AI.MISKATONIC.EDU.
	; Remote searches
	; First try it as if the user specified a complete name
	REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH	.
	; Next try for an abbreviated name which is here at Miskatonic
	;  but not in the CS or AI domains
	REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH	MISKATONIC.EDU.
	; Last try the old compatability domain
	REMOTE-SEARCH-PATH	ARPA.
	; If none of this works, give up.

This would would cause names that don't end in a "." to be tried with
the following suffixes, in the following order: "" (implicit, local),
"CS.MISKATONIC.EDU" (explicit, local), "AI.MISKATONIC.EDU" (explicit,
local), "" (explicit, remote), "MISKATONIC.EDU" (explicit, remote),
"ARPA" (explicit, remote).

Note that searching can always be inhibited by ending the query name
with a dot (this is implemented in GTDOM%).  Programs can also set a
flag (GD%EMO) to achive the same effect.

DEFAULT-SERVER entries specify the IP addresses of one or more
(preferably more) default servers.  The default servers are used when
the resolver doesn't have anything in its database telling it who to
ask for a particular name.  This is the "safety belt" design that is
occasionally referred to in the domain RFCs and on the Namedroppers
list.  Example:

	DEFAULT-SERVER	10.0.0.51	;SRI-NIC.ARPA

specifies that 10.0.0.51 is a default server.

LOAD-ZONE and PRELOAD-CACHE entries specify master files to load.  The
data field for LOAD-ZONE consists of a domain name (zone origin) and a
filename.  For PRELOAD-CACHE it's just a filename (cache is always
loaded relative to the root).  The syntax accepted in master files is
a slight extension to the specification: in particular, keywords
besides "INCLUDE" may follow a "$" flag.  The CHIVES programs use this
feature to store out-of-band information in zone files, eg, the time
at which a zone was transfered, the time at which a refresh operation
was last tried, etcetera.  See INTERN.D for the current list of
keywords.  You probably don't want to use any of these but $INCLUDE
and $ORIGIN in master files you create by hand, they are intended
primarily for communication between the programs that make up the
CHIVES system.

Example:

	LOAD-ZONE  MISKATONIC.EDU.  DOMAIN:MISKATONIC.ZONE

would load the zone MISKATONIC.EDU from DOMAIN:MISKATONIC.ZONE.
