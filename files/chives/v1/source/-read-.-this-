This directory contains source code for the CHIVES resolver and GTDOM%
module.  Eventually it will contain other parts of the CHIVES domain
system.

Note that these files copyrighted.  Also note that there is no
warranty of any kind on this code.  See the file COPYRIGHT.NOTICE for
details and restrictions.

See GTDOM.DOC in the documentation directory for information on
installing the GTDOM% JSYS.

CHIVES.CTL is a batch job that should produce a copy of all the
programs currently in the CHIVES system.  You must have a current
version of the KCC compiler (KCC-5) to compile CHIVES.  You want to
have the GTDOM% symbols in your MONSYM.UNV before attempting to
compile CHIVES; in particular, _SPRSV must be defined or your RESOLV
and your GTDOM% won't know how to talk to each other.

The output .EXE files from CHIVES.CTL are (currently):

	RESOLV.EXE	;The resolver itself
	RES0LV.EXE	;A non-extended version of the resolver
	GTDTST.EXE	;A program for testing GTDOM% and RESOLV
	RSVCTL.EXE	;Sends control messages to RESOLV
	ZT.EXE		;Zone transfer client (not really supported)

We recommend running RESOLV in extended addressing, particularly if
you load zone files, which you might well want to do for performance
reasons.  It is possible to run a non-extended version but you
probably won't be able to load zone files and you may have to tinker
with the MAXTTL and GC-PERIOD parameters in RESOLV.CONFIG to keep from
running out of memory after a day or so.

GTDTST is primarily of interest to developers, since it provides a
mechanism for testing (almost) all the functions GTDOM% provides in
both user and JSYS modes, for ease of debugging.

RSVCTL can be used to send simple control messages to the resolver,
such as PING (sollicits a response to see if the resolver is still
running at least its IPC code) and BOOT (asks resolver to reboot
itself from DOMAIN:RESOLV.EXE).

ZT is the client side of the zone transfer protocol used by
implementations of the domain name system to obtain copies of entire
zones over the network.  ZT has not received much development
attention lately, and it is often easier to just FTP/TFTP zone files
if the foreign host is willing to cooperate, but ZT can sometimes be
useful in obtaining zones that it is impractical to get via any other
means.
