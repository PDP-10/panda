	 * This stuff is in DSYMS format to avoid multiple definitions.
	 * Numeric values assigned to tokens are arbitrary, but should
	 * not be reused, just in case you forget to recompile all the
	 * modules that are affected by the change.
	 *
	 * Out-of-band data is represented as an extension of the
	 * existing syntax for $INCLUDE.  General format is:
	 *
	 *	$ <name> <argument(s)>
	 *
	 * In most cases (except $INCLUDE) the argument will be a
	 * number, but the syntax is general enough that this doesn't
	 * matter.
	 *
	 * The following tokens are currently recognized:
	 * 	ZL_DATE:	Date this zone retrieved
	 * 	ZL_RETRY:	Date we last tried to update
	 * 	ZL_CACHE:	Boolean indicating cache-ness
	 * 	ZL_HIDDEN:	Boolean indicating hidden-ness
	 * 	ZL_INCLUDE:	Included zone file
	 *	ZL_ORIGIN:	New origin for this zone file
