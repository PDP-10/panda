This directory tree, XX:<CHIVES.V1*>, contains files associated with
release 1.x  of the MIT domain system code (CHIVES).

Note that the source code is copyrighted and comes with NO WARRANTY;
see COPYRIGHT.NOTICE for details and restrictions.

XX:<CHIVES.V1.SOURCES> contains the source code for the various C
programs and for the GTDOM% JSYS and associated monitor support code.

XX:<CHIVES.V1.DOCUMENTATION> contains documentation on the CHIVES
system, such as it is.  Constructive criticism solicited, takers
please send your flames to BUG-CHIVES@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU.

XX:<CHIVES.V1.CONFIG> contains configuration files needed by the
various C programs that make up the system.  Some of these will need
to be tailored to your site.

There are -READ-.-THIS- files in the various directories giving more
detailed information.

The utilities that were provided with the beta-release in
XX:<CHIVES.BETA.KCC> are not necessary for CHIVES 1.0.  CHIVES 1.0
requires version 5 of KCC; a lot of kludges that were necessary under
earlier versions of KCC have been removed, and the sources will no
longer compile with older versions of KCC.  Some of the CHIVES modules
may not compile correctly with the initially released KCC-5 due to
bugs in the KCC optimizer; if you get a lot of inexplicable errors,
particularly illegal instruction traps with unlikely PC values, try
compiling CHIVES with the optimizer turned off.  As a last resort you
can copy C:*.* and CC:CC.EXE from XX, but it is better to get up to
date sources and binaries from the canonical source.

KCC is available from SRI International; you should get the
distribution from SRI if you don't have it already.  Requests for
information regarding KCC should be sent to BUG-KCC@SRI-NIC.ARPA.  MIT
does not distribute KCC; the KCC developers request that everybody get
a fresh distribution from them if at all possible, to minimize the
number of divergent versions.
