direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).

[7mCHNGCASE - (GOLD 1)[m
Changes the case of a range of characters as follows:
     1.  If the select range is active, the case of each alphabetic  character
         in the select range is changed.
     2.  If 1 does not apply and the  cursor  is  positioned  on  the  current
         search  string,  the  case of each alphabetic character in the search
         string is changed.  This does not apply if  a  repeat  count  greater
         than 1 is given.
     3.  If 1 and 2 do not apply, then the case of one character  is  changed.
         If  the  current  direction is ADVANCE, then the cursor moves forward
         one character after the  change  of  case  occurs.   If  the  current
         direction  is  BACKUP,  then  the cursor moves backward one character
         before the case change occurs.

3 302

line.
3 009
[7mTAB INSERT - (CTRL/I or TAB)[m

Moves the cursor in one of two ways:

     1.  If the tab size has not been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is not
         at  the  beginning  of  the  line, a tab character is inserted at the
         cursor position.
     2.  If the tab size has been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is at  the
         beginning  of  the  line,  a  number of tab characters and spaces are

moved to the right of the text in the line above.
3 300
LINE  (0)
----
Moves the cursor forward or backward to  the  nearest  beginning  of  a  line,
depending on the current direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).


OPEN LINE  (GOLD 0)
---------
Inserts a carriage return/linefeed after the  cursor  and  leaves  the  cursor
position  unchanged.   Pressing  the  OPEN  LINE key when the cursor is at the
beginning of the line creates a new blank line.
3 301
WORD  (1)
----
Moves the cursor forward or backward by  a  word,  depending  on  the  current
direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).


CHNGCASE  (GOLD 1)
--------
Changes the case of a range of characters as follows:

     1.  If the select range is active, the case of each alphabetic  character
         in the select range is changed.
     2.  If 1 does not apply and the  cursor  is  positioned  on  the  current
         search  string,  the  case of each alphabetic character in the search
         string is changed.  This does not apply if  a  repeat  count  greater
         than 1 is given.
     3.  If 1 and 2 do not apply, then the case of one character  is  changed.
         If  the  current  direction is ADVANCE, then the cursor moves forward
         one character after the  change  of  case  occurs.   If  the  current
         direction  is  BACKUP,  then  the cursor moves backward one character
         before the case change occurs.

3 302

BACKUP  (5)
------
Sets the cursor direction to backward for the CHAR,  WORD,  LINE,  EOL,  PAGE,
SECT,  SUBS, FIND, and FNDNXT keys.  BACKUP means that movement will be toward
the beginning of the buffer;  that is, to the left and up.


TOP  (GOLD 5)
---
Positions the cursor at the beginning of the text buffer.
3 306
DEL C  (6)
-----

-----
Inserts the contents of the delete character buffer directly in front  of  the
cursor.
3 307
PAGE  (7)
----
Moves the cursor to the top of a page.  A  page  is  defined  by  a  delimiter
string,  which  can  be  set  by  the  SET  ENTITY  command.  The default page
delimiter is the formfeed character (CTRL/L).


COMMAND  (GOLD 7)
-------
Allows you to input a line mode  command  to  be  executed.   The  command  is
processed when you press the ENTER key on the keypad.
3 308

3 315
LEFT  (LEFT-ARROW)
----
The <-- (left-arrow) key moves the cursor to the preceding character.


APPEND  (GOLD LEFT-ARROW)
------
Moves the select range to the end of the PASTE buffer.  The  select  range  is
all the text between the selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor
position.  If no SELECT has been made and the  cursor  is  positioned  on  the
current search string, that string is appended.
3 316
SELECT  (.)
------
Marks one end of a select range.  A select range is a block of text  on  which
various operations (such as CUT, APPEND, or FILL) can be performed.  To create
a select range, you:

     1.  Move the cursor to either the beginning or end of the text  you  wish
         to select.
     2.  Press the SELECT key.
     3.  Move the cursor to the opposite end of the text.

You can then perform the desired operation on the range.


RESET  (GOLD .)
-----

select  range, or cancels any partially-entered command string.  Also sets the
current direction to forward.
3 320
GOLD  (BLUE)
----
Lets you use the lower function of the editing keys.  Press the GOLD key, then
the key you wish to use.

You can also use the GOLD key to enter counts.  Press GOLD and then  the  main
keyboard  numeric  keys,  followed by the key to which the count should apply.
The DELETE key and CTRL/U can be used to edit the count, and thus cannot  have
a  count  applied  to  them  manner.   The  count  can  be  a  repeat-count, a
level-count, or the code for a character, depending on the terminating key.

For help on "GOLD letter" (for example, GOLD A), press the alphabetic  key  on
the main keyboard.
3 321
ENTER
-----
Processes the command that was just given.


SUBS  (GOLD ENTER)
----

and finds the next occurrence of the string.  For multiple substitutions, you:

     1.  Press SELECT.
     2.  Type the new text.
     3.  Press CUT.
     4.  Press FIND.
     5.  Enter the text you wish to replace.

Each time you press SUBS, EDT  makes  one  substitution  and  finds  the  next
occurrence  of  the  search  string.   You can use a repeat count for multiple
substitutions.
3 001
TAB COMPUTE  (CTRL/A)
-----------
Sets the indentation level count to  the  value  obtained  from  dividing  the
current  cursor column position by the SET TAB number.  If the cursor position
is not a multiple of the SET TAB number, an error results.
3 004
TAB DECREASE  (CTRL/D)
------------
Used to decrease the indentation level counter.
3 005
TAB INCREASE  (CTRL/E)
------------
Used to increase the indentation level counter.
3 006
FILL  (CTRL/F)
----
Performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill reformats  a  block  of
text  so  that  as many full words as possible are placed on each line without
exceeding the right margin.  You can set the right margin with  the  SET  WRAP
command.   If  it  is  not  set,  the  default is the terminal width - 1.  For
purposes of the FILL command, only spaces are used as word delimiters.
3 008
BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/H or BACKSPACE)
-----------------
Moves the cursor to the beginning of the  current  line.   If  the  cursor  is
already  on the beginning of a line, it moves to the beginning of the previous
line.
3 009
TAB INSERT  (CTRL/I or TAB)
----------
Moves the cursor in one of two ways:

     1.  If the tab size has not been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is not
         at  the  beginning  of  the  line, a tab character is inserted at the
         cursor position.
     2.  If the tab size has been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is at  the
         beginning  of  the  line,  a  number of tab characters and spaces are
         inserted to move the cursor to the column position that is  equal  to
         the SET TAB value times the indentation level count.

3 010
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/J or LINEFEED)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters from the cursor position to the beginning of the
word containing the cursor.  If the cursor is on the first character of a word
the previous word is deleted.
3 011
DEFINE KEY   (CTRL/K)
----------
Used to define a new function for an editing key.  You are prompted  first  to
press the key to be defined, then to enter the definition.  You can define the
key either in terms of other editing keys or  with  change  mode  subcommands.
When  you  use  an  editing  key,  its definition appears at the bottom of the
screen.
3 012
INSERT FORMFEED   (CTRL/L)
----------------
Inserts a formfeed character (<FF>) at the cursor position.
3 018
REFRESH   (CTRL/R)
-------

characters in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system
messages.  The cursor remains in the same location.
3 020
TAB ADJUST  (CTRL/T)
----------
Adjusts the tab level of the select range.  To use the key, you:

     1.  Create a select range of the text you wish to adjust.
     2.  Enter a level  count  using  the  GOLD  key.   To  decrease  the  tab
         indentation  level, precede the count with a minus sign.  The default
         level count is 1.
     3.  Use the tab adjust key.

The effect of CTRL/T is to increase or decrease the indentation level  of  the
select range by the number of tabs indicated by the level count.
3 021
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/U)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters in the current line to the left of  the  cursor.
If the cursor is on the first character of a line, the entire previous line is
deleted.
3 023
REFRESH   (CTRL/W)
-------
Refreshes  the  screen  display.   The  screen  becomes  blank  and  then  the
characters in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system
messages.  The cursor remains in the same location.
3 026
EXIT  (CTRL/Z)
----
Returns you to line editing.
3 065
TAB COMPUTE  (GOLD A)
-----------

------------
Used to decrease the indentation level counter.
3 069
TAB INCREASE  (GOLD E)
------------
Used to increase the indentation level counter.
3 070
FILL  (GOLD F)
----
Performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill reformats  a  block  of
text  so  that  as many full words as possible are placed on each line without
exceeding the right margin.  The right margin can  be  set  by  the  SET  WRAP
command.   If  it  is  not  set,  the  default is the terminal width - 1.  For
purposes of the FILL command, only spaces are used as word delimiters.
3 082
REFRESH   (GOLD R)
-------
Refreshes  the  screen  display.   The  screen  becomes  blank  and  then  the
characters in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system
messages.  The cursor remains in the same location.
3 084
TAB ADJUST  (GOLD T)
----------
Adjusts the tab level of the select range.  The key is used as follows:

     1.  Create a select range of the text you wish to adjust.
     2.  Enter a level  count  using  the  GOLD  key.   To  decrease  the  tab
         indentation  level, precede the count with a minus sign.  The default
         level count is 1.
     3.  Use the tab adjust key.

The effect of GOLD T is to increase or decrease the indentation level  of  the
select range by the number of tabs indicated by the level count.
3 085
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (GOLD U)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters in the current line to the left of  the  cursor.
If the cursor is on the first character of a line, the entire previous line is
deleted.
3 087
REFRESH   (GOLD W)
-------
Refreshes  the  screen  display.   The  screen  becomes  blank  and  then  the
characters in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system
messages.  The cursor remains in the same location.
3 090
EXIT  (GOLD Z)
----
Returns you to line editing.
1 CHANGE
The CHANGE command (abbreviated C) puts EDT in change mode.  Use  change  mode
to edit at the character level rather than the line level.

Format:  CHANGE [range] [\nokeypad commands]

The optional range specifies the cursor position when you enter  change  mode.
If you omit range, the current position is used.

There are three submodes of change mode.  Which submode you use depends on the
type  of  terminal  you  are  using  and  whether  or  not you wish to use the
auxiliary (numeric) keypad for editing commands.  These modes are:

     1.  Hardcopy mode
     2.  Keypad mode
     3.  Nokeypad mode

If the command contains a  backslash  (\)  it  may  be  followed  by  nokeypad
commands.   If  the  last nokeypad command is EX, EDT returns to line mode for
the next command line.  This is the only form of the CHANGE command  that  may
be used in a startup file or macro.
2 ENTITIES
Entities are used in change mode subcommands to specify the text  on  which  a
subcommand  will operate.  Each entity represents a portion of text, which may
be anything from a single character to an entire text buffer.   Most  entities
can  be  preceded  by  a  count,  which indicates the number of entities to be
affected.
3 CHARACTER
The character entity is specified by  the  letter  C.   It  selects  a  single
character of text.
3 WORD
A word consists of a string of characters  terminated  by  one  of  a  set  of
delimiter  characters.   The  default  delimiter  characters are spaces, tabs,
carriage returns, line  feeds,  formfeeds,  and  vertical  tabs.   Spaces  are
handled  in  a  special  way:   all  spaces  following  a word up to the first
non-space character are considered part of a word.  Other delimiters  are  not
considered part of the word they terminate.  Rather, they are considered to be
words by themselves, unless NODELIMITERS has been set.  If NODELIMTERS is set,
delimiters  are  not considered words by themselves but are considered part of
the word they terminate.  The three word entities are:

    W   Specifies the entire word in which the cursor is positioned.
    BW  Specifies all characters preceding the cursor up to the  beginning  of
        the word.
    EW  Specifies all characters from the cursor through the end of the word.

You can change the word delimiters with the SET ENTITY command.
3 LINE
The line entities are:

    L   Specifies the entire line in which the cursor is positioned.
    BL  Specifies all characters preceding the cursor up to the beginning of a
        line.   (When the cursor is positioned at the beginning of a line, the
        BL entity selects the entire previous line.)
    EL  Specifies all characters from  the  cursor  to  the  end  of  a  line,
        including  the  character  on which the cursor is positioned.  (If the
        cursor is on a line terminator, the entire next line is selected.)
    NL  Specifies all characters from the cursor to the beginning of the  next
        line, including the character on which the cursor is positioned.
3 RANGE
The range entities specify all text in the buffer either before or  after  the
cursor.  The two range entities are:

    BR  Specifies the text from the cursor position to the  beginning  of  the
        buffer.
    ER  Specifies the text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer.
3 SENTENCE
A sentence consists of a string of characters terminated by one of  a  set  of
single  character  delimiters.   The  default sentence delimiters are:  period
(.), question mark (?), and exclamation point (!).  A  sentence  delimiter  is
considered  to  be  a delimiter only if it is at the end of a line or if it is
followed by a space.  The line terminator or trailing spaces are considered  a
part of the sentence.  There are three sentence entities:

    SEN   Specifies the entire sentence in which  the  cursor  is  positioned,
          including the delimiter and trailing spaces or line terminator.
    BSEN  Specifies  all  characters  preceding  the  cursor  in  the  current
          sentence.
    ESEN  Specifies all characters in the current sentence from the cursor  to
          (but not including) the delimiter character.

The sentence delimiters can be changed by the SET ENTITY command.
3 PAGE
A page consists of all the text between two  page  delimiters,  including  the
trailing   page  delimiter.   The  default  page  delimiter  is  the  formfeed
character.  The three page entities are:

    PAGE  Specifies all of the current page.
    BPAGE Specifies all characters in the  current  page  from  the  character
          preceding the cursor to the beginning of the page.
    EPAGE Specifies all characters in the current page from the cursor to (but
          not including) the page delimiter.

You can change the page delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 PARAGRAPH
A paragraph consists  of  all  the  text  between  two  paragraph  delimiters,
including  the  trailing  paragraph delimiter, and if WPS is set, any adjacent
delimiters.   The  default  paragraph  delimiter  is  two   consecutive   line
terminators.  The three paragraph entities are:

    PAR   Specifies all of the current paragraph.
    BPAR  Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from the character
          preceding the cursor to the beginning of the paragraph.
    EPAR  Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from the cursor to
          (but not including) the paragraph delimiter.

You can change the paragraph delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 SELECT
The select entity consists of all characters between the cursor and the select
mark.   The  select  mark  must  have  been  specified  previously  by  a  SEL
subcommand.  The select range entity is specified by SR.   Some  commands  use
the search string when SR is used and no select mark has been specified.
3 VERTICAL
The vertical line entity is the same as the line entity, except that with  the
V  entity,  the  cursor  stays  in  the same column.  You specify the vertical
entity with V.
3 STRING
The string entity consists of all the characters between the  cursor  and  the
next  occurrence  of  a specified search string.  Specify the string entity by
enclosing the desired search string in single or double quotes.  If the string
is null (specified by '' or ""), the previous search string is used again.

For key definitions, you may use the null character  (ASCII  character  0)  in
place of the quotes to avoid conflicts with the search string.
2 HARDCOPY
On a hardcopy terminal, change mode operates like this:

When you enter change mode, EDT displays the current  line  on  the  terminal.
The  cursor position is marked by bracketing the character on which the cursor
is positioned.  EDT will then prompt with the characters:

C*

In response, you type a series of change  mode  subcommands  terminated  by  a
carrige return.  EDT will execute the commands and retype the line.
2 KEYPAD
You enter the keypad submode of change mode when your terminal is a  VT100  or
VT52  and  the  keypad  option is on.  (This option is on by default for these
terminals.) In this submode, the terminal screen is  used  to  view  the  text
buffer.  Characters typed on the main keyboard are inserted into the buffer at
the cursor position.   You  enter  editing  commands  by  using  keys  on  the
auxiliary keypad, function keys, or control keys on the main keyboard.

For more help on keypad mode, type CHANGE to enter that mode.  Use the  keypad
HELP facility as follows:

     1.  If your terminal is a VT100, press the keypad key marked PF2.
     2.  If your terminal is a VT52, press the red keypad key.

2 SCREEN
You enter the screen submode of change mode if your terminal  is  a  VT100  or
VT52 and the SET NOKEYPAD command has been used to turn off the keypad option.
The screen is used as a window into the text buffer.   You  type  change  mode
commands  at  the  keyboard;  they echo on the bottom line of the screen.  EDT
executes the commands and updates the text on the screen whenever you  type  a
carriage return.
2 SUBCOMMANDS
When EDT is in change mode, it accepts a distinct set of commands  called  the
change  mode subcommands.  You may concatenate a string of subcommands with or
without spaces separating them.

Subcommands take one of the  following  forms,  depending  on  the  particular
command:

     1.  command
     2.  [+|-] [count] command
     3.  [+|-] [count] [command] [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]

Whenever a sign can appear in more than one place,  the  last  sign  specified
determines the direction.
3 ADV
The ADV command sets the cursor direction to advance.   Many  subcommands  use
the  current  direction  to  determine  whether entities to the left or to the
right of the cursor are to  be  affected.   When  the  direction  is  advance,
subcommands affect the cursor character and characters to the right.

Format:  ADV
3 APPEND
The APPEND command works in the same way as the CUT command (see  CUT)  except
that  it  adds  the  new  text  to  the end of the alternate buffer instead of
replacing its contents.

Format:  [+|-] [count] APPEND [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]
3 ASC
The ASC subcommand inserts a specified ASCII character into the buffer at  the
cursor  position.   Use  the  count field to indicate the decimal value of the
ASCII character you want to insert.

Format:  [count] ASC

The ASC command is the only way to insert a carriage return into the middle of
a  line  of text;  otherwise, insert commands always treat the carriage return
as a line terminator.  The following command would insert a carriage return:

     13ASC (13 is the ASCII code for carriage return)
3 BACK
The BACK command sets the cursor direction to backup.   Many  subcommands  use
the  current  direction  to  determine  whether entities to the left or to the
right of the cursor are  to  be  affected.   When  the  direction  is  backup,
subcommands affect characters to the left of the cursor.

Format:  BACK
3 BELL
The BELL command rings the bell on the terminal.  There is no  effect  on  the
text buffer.

Format:  BELL
3 CHGC
The CHGC command changes  the  case  of  every  alphabetic  character  in  the
specified  number  of  entities:   lowercase  characters  become uppercase and
uppercase become lowercase.

Format:  [+|-] [count] CHGC [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity

CHGCSR (change case of select region)  works  differently:   If  there  is  no
select  range  and the cursor is in the search string, CHGCSR changes the case
of every alphabetic character in the search string.  If  there  is  no  select
range  and  the cursor is not in the search string, CHGCSR changes the case of
the character under the cursor, if it is alphabetic.  If the [count] field  is
two or more, CHGCSR ignores the search string condition.
3 CHGL
The CHGL command forces every alphabetic character in the specified  range  to
lowercase.

Format:  [+|-] [count] CHGL [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity

CHGLSR has the same special contingencies as CHGCSR.
3 CHGU
The CHGU command forces every alphabetic character in the specified  range  to
uppercase.

Format:  [+|-] [count] CHGU [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity

CHGUSR has the same special contingencies as CHGCSR.
3 CLSS
The CLSS command clears the search string buffer.

Format:  CLSS
3 CUT
The CUT command deletes a specified number  of  entities  and  saves  all  the
deleted  text in an alternate text buffer.  The command works exactly like the
DELETE command except that the text is saved.

Format:  [+|-] [count] CUT [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]

If you do not specify a buffer, the buffer named PASTE is used.

Ex:  CUTSR   Cut the selected range
     CUTPAGE Cut the current page of text
3 D
The D subcommand deletes a specified number of entities.

Format:  [+|-] [repeat-count] D [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity

If the entity is C, W, BW, EW, L, BL, EL, or NL, the last  entity  deleted  by
the  command  is saved in the delete buffer associated with the entity and can
be restored with the UNDELETE C, W, or L subcommand.

Ex: D15C    Deletes 15 characters in the current direction.
    DSR     Deletes the select range.
    DBR     Deletes to the beginning of the buffer.
3 DATE
The DATE command inserts the current date and time string into the  buffer  at
the current cursor position.

The form of the string is:  dd-Mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss .  Note the  trailing  space.
Before  the  tenth  of the month the dd is a space followed by a single digit.
This command always uses the English abbreviations for month names.

Format:  DATE
3 DEFK
The DEFK command assigns new definitions to editing keys.   You  are  prompted
first  to  press the key to be defined, then to enter the definition.  You can
define the key either in terms of other editing keys or by use of change  mode
subcommands.   If  you use a keypad or function key, its definition appears at
the bottom of the screen.  You should only use this command in  keypad  change
mode.

Format:  DEFK
3 DESEL
The DESEL command cancels the current select range if one is  active.   If  no
select range is active the command has no effect.

Format:  DESEL
3 DLWC
The DLWC command sets the default command to CHGL.  With this as  the  default
command,  a MOVE command moves the cursor the specified number of entities and
leaves each moved alphabetic character as lowercase.

Format:  DLWC
3 DMOV
The DMOV command returns the  default  command  to  MOVE.   When  the  default
command  is  MOVE,  a  MOVE  command  moves the cursor the specified number of
entities and changes no text.

Format:  DMOV
3 DUPC
The DUPC command is used to set the default command to CHGU.  With this as the
default  command,  a  MOVE  command  moves  the cursor the specified number of
entities and leaves each moved alphabetic character as uppercase.

Format:  DUPC
3 EXIT
The EXIT command exits change mode (not the editor).  When the exit command is
executed you return to line mode.

Format:  EX
3 EXT
The EXT command executes a line mode command while you  are  in  change  mode.
EDT  interprets  the  remainder  of  the  command line as a line mode command,
executes the command, and reenters change mode automatically.

Format:  EXT line mode command
3 FILL
The FILL command reformats a block of text so that as many complete  words  as
possible  are placed on each line without exceeding the right margin.  It sets
the right margin to the terminal width minus  1  character  by  default.   The
margin may be changed by the SET WRAP command.

Format:  [+|-] [count] FILL [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
3 HELP
The HELP command  causes  a  diagram  of  keypad  functions  and  CONTROL  key
descriptions  to  appear  on  the  screen.  If executed in keypad change mode,
additional information can be obtained by pressing keypad or control keys;  in
nokeypad mode, pressing any subsequent key returns you to editing mode.
3 I
The I command inserts new text into the buffer at the current cursor position.

Format:  I text to be inserted ^Z

This command behaves differently in each mode:

     1.  In keypad mode, insert text by typing on the main keyboard;   you  do
         not need to begin the insert with I or end it with ^Z.
     2.  In nokeypad mode, type I to begin inserting  text.   You  can  insert
         text from the keyboard until you enter ^Z;  you can enter one or more
         lines of text.
     3.  In hardcopy mode, type I to begin inserting  text.   You  can  insert
         text  from  the  keyboard  until  you enter either a ^Z or a carriage
         return.

3 KS
The KS command modifies the cursor position after a PASTE command.

Format:  KS

After a PASTE command, the cursor is on the character  to  the  right  of  the
pasted  text.   If  PASTE  is followed by KS, however, the cursor moves to the
last pasted character if the current direction is advance  and  to  the  first
pasted  character  if  the  direction  is  backup.  You should only use the KS
command immediately after a PASTE command.

Such cursor positioning affects a subsequent string search.  KS is used in the
definition  of the keypad SUBS function so that the character that follows the
pasted text in the current direction is included in the next string search.
3 MOVE
The MOVE command moves the cursor a specified  number  of  entities.   If  the
default command is lowercase, all alphabetic characters encountered are forced
to lowercase.  If the default command is uppercase, all alphabetic  characters
encountered are forced to uppercase.  With the default command set to move, no
text is changed.

Format:  [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity

If you use an explicit sign, the direction of the move is determined  by  that
sign  (+  for forward, - for backward);  otherwise, the current direction mode
(set by the ADV and BACK commands) is used to determine the direction.

Ex:  +3W     Moves the cursor 3 words forward.
     L       Moves the cursor 1 line in the current direction.
     -PAGE   Moves the cursor backward to a page mark.
3 PASTE
The PASTE command copies the contents of an alternate buffer into the  current
buffer at the cursor position.

Format:  [count] PASTE [=buffer]

If you omit the buffer name, the PASTE buffer is used.
3 QUIT
The QUIT subcommand leaves the editor without saving any text  buffers.   This
will  cause  you  to lose any editing you have done in this session unless you
used the WRITE command to save the text before quitting.

Format:  QUIT
3 R
The R(eplace) command has the same form as the D command.  In  nokeypad  mode,
the R command will enter insert mode after the text is deleted.

Format:  [+|-] [repeat-count] R [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
3 REF
The REF command refreshes the screen.

Format:  REF
3 S
The S command replaces occurrences of one string of characters with another.

Format:  [+|-] [count] S/string-1/string-2/

The slashes represent any non-alphanumeric character used to delimit  the  two
strings.   S  searches in the specified direction from the cursor and finds an
occurrence of string-1.  It deletes  string-1  and  inserts  string-2  in  its
place.
3 SEL
The SEL command marks a portion of text that will  be  one  end  of  a  select
range.   You  create  a  select  range  by marking one end of the desired text
(either end will do), moving to the other end, and performing an operation  on
the SR (select range) entity.

Format:  SEL
3 SHIFT
Use the SHIFT LEFT and SHIFT RIGHT commands to alter the left margin  when  in
change  mode.   The left margin is the position of the first character in each
line on the  screen.   Normally,  the  left  margin  is  0,  which  means  all
characters  are  displayed.   If you use a SHR command, the left margin can be
changed by an integral number of tab stops (8 characters).   If  SHL  is  used
once,  the  first  8 columns will not be displayed on the screen.  This shifts
the screen window horizontally.

Format: count SHL (Shift left by count tab stops)
        count SHR (Shift right by count tab stops)
3 SSEL
The SSEL command searches for the occurrence of a string and places the string
in the select range.  The cursor remains at the far end of the string.

Format:  SSEL"string"
3 SN
The SN command performs  a  SUBSTITUTE  command  using  the  same  search  and
replacement strings as the previous SUBSTITUTE command.

Format:  [+|-] [count] SN
3 TAB
Use the TAB subcommand when the structured tab feature is enabled.  Insert the
correct  number of tabs and blanks to position to the current tab level.  When
structured tabs have not been enabled or the cursor is not at the beginning of
a line, this command inserts a tab character.

Format:  TAB
3 TADJ
The TADJ command adjusts the tab level for the selected range  of  text.   The
tab  size  and  level-count  set  the  tab  level  (see TC).  The tab level is
adjusted by the value of  level-count;   it  is  incremented  for  a  positive
level-count  and  decremented  for  a negative level-count.  A level-count not
preceded by + or - is assumed positive.  The TADJ tab setting is  the  product
of the tab size and the indentation level.

Format:  [+|-] [level-count] TADJ [+|-] [entity-count] [+|-] entity

Note that the + or - that precedes the level-count is not used to  modify  the
direction  of  entity selection.  Its function in this command differs in this
way from all other commands taking the above format.
3 TC
The TC subcommand computes the tab level from  the  current  cursor  position.
This  command has meaning only if the structured tab feature has been enabled.
See the SET TAB command.

Format:  TC
3 TD
The TD subcommand decreases the tab level counter.  This command  has  meaning
only  when  the  structured  tab  feature  has  been enabled.  See the SET TAB
command.

Format:  TD
3 TGSEL
The TGSEL command allows you to toggle select.  That is, when the select range
is  active,  TGSEL  will cancel it, and where no select range is active, TGSEL
will enable it.

Format:  TGSEL
3 TI
The TI subcommand increases the tab level counter.  This commmand has  meaning
only  when  the  structured  tab  feature  has  been enabled.  See the SET TAB
command.

Format:  TI
3 TOP
The TOP command forces the line on which the cursor is positioned to  the  top
of the screen.

Format:  TOP
3 UNDELETE
The UNDELETE commands restore the last entity deleted by a delete command.

Format: UNDC (undelete character)
        UNDW (undelete word)
        UNDL (undelete line)
3 ()
A sequence of subcommands can also be enclosed in parentheses to form a single
unit.   A  numeric literal preceding the left parenthesis indicates the number
of times to repeat the entire sequence.
3 ^
This command provides for the insertion of control characters  in  text.   EDT
accepts  a  circumflex (^) followed by an alphabetic character and inserts the
corresponding control character in the text as a single character.

Format:  [count]^[A..Z]
1 CLEAR
The CLEAR (abbreviated CL) command deletes all the text in a buffer.

Format:  CLEAR buffer-name

All the text in the specified buffer is deleted.  (Note that the argument is a
buffername,  not  a  range  specification:   CLEAR PASTE is valid, while CLEAR
=PASTE and CLEAR BUFFER PASTE are not.)
1 COPY
The COPY (abbreviated CO) command copies text from  one  location  to  another
within  a  buffer  or  between  buffers.  When text is copied, the source text
remains intact.

Format:  COPY [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY] [/DUPLICATE:n]

The lines specified by range-1 are copied in front of the first line specified
by range-2.  Either range defaults to the current line.

If the destination is not the current buffer, put the name  of  the  receiving
buffer  immediately after TO (=buffer).  Give the full name of the buffer.  To
copy text from an external file, see INCLUDE.
2 /DUPLICATE
When you use the /DUPLICATE (abbreviated /D) qualifier, the lines specified by
range-1 are duplicated n times.

Format:  /DUPLICATE:n
2 /QUERY
When you use the /QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier, EDT  prompts  you  with  a
question mark (?) to verify each line to be copied.

Format:  /QUERY

Responses are:

    Y   Yes, copy this line
    N   No, do not copy this line
    Q   Quit, do not copy any of the rest of the lines
    A   All, copy all the rest of the lines
1 DEFINE
The DEFINE command (abbreviated DEF) defines either editing  keys  for  keypad
mode or macros for line mode.
2 KEY
The DEFINE KEY (abbreviated DEF K) command defines customized editing  keypads
or  extends  the keypad now available by using additional control keys.  It is
also used to define function keys, for terminals that have function keys.

Format:  DEFINE KEY key-selector AS "string"
3 KEY-SELECTOR
Format:  DEFINE KEY key-selector AS "string"

Key-selector is one of the following

        [GOLD] CONTROL letter
        [GOLD] CONTROL "letter"
         GOLD  character
         GOLD  "character"
        [GOLD] DELETE

Number refers to keypad and function keys and CONTROL  letter  names  specific
control keys (upper- and lowercase letters are considered equivalent).  DELETE
refers to the delete key, which is not a control character.  Character  refers
to any keyboard key except 0-9.  Characters !, ?, ;, and " must be enclosed in
quotes, others may be.  With " an extra quote is required, ie, """".
3 STRING
Format:  DEFINE KEY key-selector AS "string"

The string is a string of change mode subcommands that define the function  of
the  key.   If you want the command to be executed when the key is struck, the
definition must end with a period;  otherwise, EDT will accumulate definitions
until  the  user types a key whose definition ends with a period, then execute
them all together.
4 QUERY
You can use a question mark (?) or question mark and  asterisk  (?*),  in  key
definitions  to  request  input from the user.  The ?  is then replaced by the
characters read from the terminal before the command is  executed.   A  prompt
string  enclosed  in  single  quotes may follow the ?.  A response to an input
request generated by a ?  must be terminated by  a  keypad  or  function  key,
whereas  a  response to a ?* may be terminated by a keypad key, a function key
or a carriage return.
4 RESET
If you define a key as "RESET" (must be exactly five characters) the key  will
perform the reset keypad function.  RESET is not a nokeypad command.
4 GOLD
If you define a key as "GOLD" the key will perform the gold  keypad  function.
GOLD is not a nokeypad command.
3 EXAMPLES
To define the key CTRL/A to move 3 lines, use the following command:

     DEFINE KEY CONTROL A AS "3L."

To define the GOLDed function of the up-arrow  key  to  mean  "go  to  top  of
buffer," use the following command:

     DEFINE KEY GOLD 12 AS "BR."

To define the key CTRL/D to write your COBOL  identification  division  header
for you, use the following command:

     DEFINE KEY CONTROL D AS "iIDENTIFICATION DIVISION.^Z^MiPROGRAM-ID.  ?^Z."

(After pressing the key, give the program name.)

To define the CTRL/R key to prompt for the name of a BLISS routine,  which  it
will then find, use the following commmand:

     DEFINE KEY CONTROL R AS "BR ADV 'ROUTINE ?'Routine name:  ''."

2 MACRO
The DEFINE MACRO (abbreviated DEF M) command defines line mode macro commands.

Format:  DEFINE MACRO name

The name is the name of the text buffer in which the  macro  is  stored.   The
macro itself is a series of EDT line-mode commands.

Invoke the macro by giving its name in response to the line mode prompt.
1 DELETE
The DELETE (abbreviated D) command deletes the lines specified by the range.

Format:  DELETE [range] [/QUERY]

If you do not specify the range, the default is the current line.
2 /QUERY
When you use the QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier,  EDT  prompts  you  with  a
question mark (?) to verify each line to be deleted.

Format:  /QUERY

Responses are:

    Y   Yes, delete this line
    N   No, do not delete this line
    Q   Quit, do not delete any of the rest of the lines
    A   All, delete all the rest of the lines
1 EXIT
The EXIT (abbreviated EX) command terminates all  action  in  the  editor  and
saves a copy of the MAIN text buffer in the output file.

Format:  EXIT [file-spec] [/SAVE] [/GO]

If you omit the file specification, the output file name from the command line
that  invoked  EDT is used.  If no output file name has been specified, and if
/READONLY and /NOOUTPUT have not been specified, then the input file  name  is
used.
2 /SAVE
When you use the /SAVE (abbreviated /S) qualifier, the journal file is  saved.
The journal file is called 'name.JOU', where name is the output file name from
the command line.  For  information  about  the  journal  facility,  see  HELP
JOURNAL.
2 /GO
When you use the /GO option (abbreviated /G), the last load class command used
before  entering  EDT will be re-executed.  These commands are COMPILE, DEBUG,
EXECUTE, and LOAD.  This simplifies  the  task  of  editing  and  testing  new
programs.

Format:  /GO
1 FILL
The FILL (abbreviated FIL) command reformats a block of text so that there are
as many full words on a line as possible without exceeding the right margin.

Format:  FILL [range]

The lines in the range must be contiguous.  If you omit the range, the  select
range is assumed.

The right margin is set by the SET WRAP command.  If the margin has  not  been
set, the default is the terminal width minus 1.
1 FIND
The FIND (abbreviated F) command places the cursor at the first line specified
by range.

Format:  FIND [range]

The located line is not typed.  To find and type a line, use the TYPE command.

Ex: F =X  Returns EDT's attention to buffer X, to the line EDT was on when  it
          last left buffer X.
1 INCLUDE
The INCLUDE (abbreviated INC) command copies external files into text buffers.

Format:  INCLUDE file-spec [range]

The specified file is copied to the location before  the  first  line  of  the
range.   Note  that  range  specifies  the  position to which the file will be
copied;  it does not restrict the portion of the file which will be  included.
To  include  part  of  a file, first INCLUDE the file into a buffer, then COPY
text from the buffer.
1 INSERT
The INSERT (abbreviation:  I) command inserts new text into a text buffer.

Format:  INSERT [range] [\line to be inserted]

The new text is inserted before the first line specified  by  range.   If  you
omit  range,  new text is inserted just before the line at which the cursor is
located.

If you do not use the optional backslash, the editor enters insert  mode.   In
insert mode, you can enter as many lines of text as you wish, terminating each
line with a carriage return.  Terminate insert mode by typing CTRL/Z.

If you choose the optional backslash, the  text  on  the  line  following  the
backslash  is inserted and the editor does not enter insert mode.  This is the
only form of the INSERT command that should be  used  in  a  startup  file  or
macro.

The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 JOURNAL
EDT saves all input from the terminal during an  editing  session  in  a  file
called the journal file.  The journal file is deleted when you exit the editor
with an EXIT command or a QUIT command (without the  /SAVE  option).   If  the
editor is left involuntarily, the journal file is saved.

The journal file can be used to redo all the operations of an editing session.
The  edited  file  is  thereby  recreated.   Type  the  same command line used
previously with the addition of the /RECOVER qualifier.

Unless explicitly overridden by the /JOURNAL qualifier on  the  command  line,
the  journal  file will have the same name as the output file, except that the
file type will be JOU.
1 MOVE
The MOVE (abbreviated M) command moves text  from  one  location  to  another,
deleting it from the original location.

Format:  MOVE [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY]

The lines specified by range-1 are moved to a location immediately before  the
first  line  specified  by  range-2.   The lines are deleted from the original
location.  If you omit either of the range specifications, the current line is
used.   The first line of range-2 becomes the new current line.  To move lines
of text without deleting  them  from  the  original  location,  see  the  COPY
command.
2 /QUERY
When you use the QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier,  EDT  prompts  you  with  a
question mark (?) to verify each line to be moved.

Format:  /QUERY

Responses are:

    Y   Yes, move this line.
    N   No, do not move this line.
    Q   Quit, do not move any of the rest of the lines.
    A   All, move all the rest of the lines.
1 PRINT
The PRINT (abbreviated PR) command creates a listing file with  the  specified
file name.

Format:  PRINT file-spec [range]

The lines selected by range are written to a listing  format  file  with  page
headers.  If the NUMBERS option is set (see SET NUMBERS), the EDT line numbers
will appear on the listing.  If you omit range, the entire current  buffer  is
printed.   Print  does not alter the current line.  Use PRINT only to create a
listing.  If you wish to create a file, use the WRITE command.
1 PUSH
The PUSH (abbreviated PU) command  temporarily  transfers  control  to  system
level  without  disturbing  the  editing  session.   Any system command can be
executed, but you should not attempt to edit the same file.  To return to  the
editing session type POP.
1 QUIT
The QUIT command exits the editor without saving  the  contents  of  the  MAIN
buffer.  The QUIT command cannot be abbreviated.

Format:  QUIT [/SAVE]

Use the QUIT command only if you have made no changes to the  buffer  you  are
editing  or  if  you have decided you do not wish to save the changes you have
made.  All edits will be discarded when you QUIT from the editor.
2 /SAVE
The SAVE qualifier specifies that the journal file should be saved.  Normally,
the journal file is deleted when you QUIT.
1 RANGE
Range specifications select the exact lines of text on which the line  editing
command will operate.

There are several general classes of range specifications:

     1.  Single line ranges specify a single line of text.
     2.  Multiple line ranges specify blocks of text, such as an entire buffer
         or all lines from the current line to the end of the buffer.
     3.  Compound ranges combine single line ranges with operators to  specify
         multiple lines of text.
     4.  Noncontiguous ranges specify multiple lines that are not  necessarily
         adjacent to one another.

2 ALL
The ALL range further refines a general range specification.

Format:  [range] ALL "string"

While range can be a single, multiple, or compound range,  the  command  being
performed  will only apply to those lines of text containing the given string.
This string must be enclosed in double quotes.

Ex:   TYPE ALL "EDT"          When ALL is  used,  the  default  for  range  is
                              WHOLE.   This command will type all the lines in
                              the current buffer containing the string "EDT".
      SUBS/A/B/50:100 ALL "1" Substitute B for A in lines from 50 to 100 which
                              include the string 1.
2 AND
The AND range selects a group of single lines.

Format:   range-1 AND range-2 AND range-3 ...  or
          range-1 , range-2 , range-3

Each of the ranges must be a single line range.  Each of the single  lines  is
operated on.

Ex: TYPE 4 AND 7      Lines 4 and 7 are displayed on the terminal
    TYPE BEGIN,END-1  The first and last lines are displayed on the terminal
2 BEGIN
The BEGIN range (abbreviated B) is a single  line  range  that  specifies  the
first line in the buffer.
2 BEFORE
The BEFORE range (abbreviated BEF) is a multiple line range that specifies all
the lines in the buffer preceding the current line.
2 BUFFER
The  BUFFER  (abbreviated  BU)  specification  may  precede  any  other  range
specification and indicates that the range is to be applied to a named buffer.

Format:   BUFFER name [range] or
          =name [range]

The two forms are equivalent.  Name is the name of the  buffer  in  which  the
text resides.  If you leave out the range, the entire buffer is selected.
2 DOT
The dot (.) is a single line range that refers to the current  line  of  text.
For  many commands, dot is the default range.  See the help text for a command
if you are unsure of the default.

Ex:  TYPE .  Type the current line.
2 END
The END (abbreviated E) range specifies an imaginary line following  the  last
line  in  the  buffer.  END does not specify the last line in the buffer.  The
last line can be referred to by E-1 (that is, the line preceding  END).   When
the END line is typed, it looks like:

[EOB]
2 FOR
The FOR range is a multiple line range that  selects  a  specified  number  of
lines starting at a specified location.

Format:   [range] FOR n or
          [range] # n

The two forms are equivalent.  Range is a single line range that specifies the
starting  position,  and  n  is  an  integer number.  If range is omitted, the
current line is the starting position.

Ex: TYPE . FOR 5        Type 5 lines, starting with the current line
    TYPE #5             Equivalent to the previous example
    TYPE BEGIN FOR 10   Type the first 10 lines in the buffer
2 LAST
The LAST (abbreviated L) range is a single line range that refers to the  line
in  a  previous  buffer  which  was  the current line when you switched to the
current buffer.
2 MINUS
The minus sign (-) in ranges selects a single line that is a specified  number
of lines before a specified line.

Format:  [range] - [n]

Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected  is  the
line  that  is n lines before the line specified by range.  If you omit range,
the current line is used;  if you omit n, 1 is used.

Ex: TYPE 15 - 3         Type the third line before the line numbered 15.
    TYPE END -1         Type the last line in the buffer.
    TYPE -              Type the previous line.
2 NUMBER
A line number is a single line range  that  refers  to  the  line  having  the
specified number.  The line number may contain a decimal point.

Ex: TYPE 10     Type line number 10.
    INSERT 65.3 Insert before line 65.3.

The maximum allowable line number is 45035996273.  A line number may  have  up
to five digits to the right of the decimal point.

You can change the line number with the RESEQUENCE command.  In addition,  the
INSERT  and INCLUDE commands will automatically change the numbers of existing
lines if necessary to make each line in a buffer to have a line number  larger
than the previous line.

When lines are read from the primary input file and  that  file  has  sequence
numbers,  the  line number assigned is the sequence number from the file, plus
N*100000, where N is large enough to ensure that each line in the buffer has a
line  number  larger  than  the previous line.  File sequence numbers range in
value from 0 to 99999.
2 ORIGINAL
Format:  ORIGINAL n

The ORIGINAL (abbreviated O) range is no longer a feature of EDT.  The keyword
ORIGINAL is ignored;  the number specified is taken as an editing line number.
See HELP RANGE NUMBER for more information.
2 PLUS
The plus sign selects, in ranges, a single line that is a specified number  of
lines after a specified line.

Format:  [range] + [n]

Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected  is  the
line  that  is  n lines after the line specified by range.  If you omit range,
the current line is used.  If you omit n, 1 is used.

Ex: T 15 + 3      Type the third line after the line numbered 15.
    T BEGIN +1    Type the second line in the buffer.
    T +           Type the line following the current line.
    T "string"+2  Type the second line  following  the  next  line  containing
                  "string".
2 REST
The REST (abbreviated R) range is a multiple line range  that  refers  to  the
current line and all lines following in the buffer.
2 SELECT
The SELECT range is a multiple line range that contains all lines between  the
current  line  and the SELECT mark.  The SELECT mark is set by the change mode
SEL subcommand.
2 STRING
A quoted string specifies a single line that contains  the  specified  string.
You  must enclose the string in double quotes (").  When you use a string as a
range, EDT will search forward, starting  with  the  current  line,  until  it
locates  a  line  with the specified string.  If a minus sign (-) precedes the
string, the search will be backward.

Ex: T "abc"     Locate and type the  first  line  forward  that  contains  the
                string "abc".
    T -"abc"    Same, except the search will be backward.
2 THRU
The THRU range is a compound range that specifies all lines between two single
line ranges.

Format:   range-1 THRU range-2 or
          range-1 :  range-2

Both forms are equivalent.  Starting with range-1, EDT selects all  the  lines
up to and including the line specified by range-2.

Ex: TYP 15:30         Type all lines with numbers between 15 and 30.
    TYP "glorp":END   Type all lines from the first  line  forward  containing
                    "glorp" to the end.
2 WHOLE
The WHOLE (abbreviated W) range refers to the entire text buffer.
1 REPLACE
The REPLACE (abbreviated R) command deletes the specified range of  lines  and
then places EDT in INSERT mode.

Format:  REPLACE [range] [\text to insert]

When you do not specify a range, replace deletes the current line and  inserts
the new text at that location.

If you do not use the optional backslash, the editor enters insert  mode.   In
insert  mode you can enter as many lines of text as you wish, terminating each
line with a carriage return.  You terminate insert mode by typing CTRL/Z.

If you use the optional backslash, EDT inserts the text in  the  command  line
following  the  backslash  and the editor does not enter insert mode.  This is
the only form of the REPLACE command that should be used in startup files  and
macros.

The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 RECOGNITION
The recognition feature of  the  TOPS-20  command  parser  may  be  used  with
commands  entered in line mode or on the initial command line.  Two characters
are used to assist with command entry, these are query (?) and escape (ESC).

If you press query at the start of a field in a command, the system will  list
the possible elements which may be entered at that point.  For example:

Typing:     res ?
Produces:   res A valid range specification
            res

If you press ESC part-way through a keyword or file specification the rest  of
the  entity  and any appropriate guide words will be typed by the system.  For
example:

Typing:     res<ESC>
Produces:   resEQUENCE (LINES IN THE RANGE) 
1 RESEQUENCE
The RESEQUENCE (abbreviated RES) command assigns new line numbers to  a  range
of lines.

Format:  RESEQUENCE [range] [/SEQUENCE:init:incr]

The specified range of lines must be contiguous.  When you do  not  specify  a
range,  all  lines  in the current buffer are resequenced.  If the new numbers
assigned would cause duplicate or nonsequential line numbers, EDT will  either
disallow the command or renumber lines beyond the specified range.

Note that the total count  of  lines  resequenced  (which  is  displayed  upon
completion  of  the  command),  may differ from the number of lines originally
specified in the range, due to the possibility of extra renumbering.
2 /SEQUENCE
The SEQUENCE (abbreviated /SEQ) qualifier specifies the sequence of numbers to
be  assigned.   The  init  parameter  specifies  the  initial number, and incr
specifies the number by which the lines are incremented.  If you  do  not  use
the SEQUENCE qualifier, init and incr both default to 1.

The maximum allowable line number is 45035996273.  If, during resequencing,  a
line  number  plus 'incr' would exceed this value, that line and all remaining
lines will be numbered 45035996273.  You should correct  this  immediately  by
resequencing with a different 'init' and/or smaller 'incr'.
1 SET
The SET (abbreviated SE)  command  sets  options  that  control  other  editor
operations.   Once set, these options are in effect throughout the rest of the
edit session or until changed by the SET command.
2 AUTOREPEAT
The SET AUTOREPEAT (abbreviated SE AUTOREPEAT) command enables  EDT's  use  of
the  DECARM  VT100 control sequence to prevent keypad, function and arrow keys
from repeating faster than EDT can update the screen.  If you do not want  EDT
to   manipulate   the   VT100's   autorepeat  feature,  use  SET  NOAUTOREPEAT
(abbreviated SE NOAUTOREPEAT).  On some VT100-class terminals, SET  AUTOREPEAT
can cause the arrow keys to repeat at the rate of 2 per second rather than the
usual 30 per second.  With SET NOAUTOREPEAT the arrow keys repeat faster,  but
the screen is not be updated for each repeat of the arrow key, since EDT skips
intermediate updates if it gets behind.

On the VT100 with a printer port (not the VT102, which has  its  printer  port
built  in),  SET NOAUTOREPEAT can cause the terminal to stop transmitting.  If
this happens, you can fix it by clearing the keyboard buffer.   To  clear  the
keyboard buffer, push the SET-UP key twice.

Format:  SET [NO]AUTOREPEAT
2 CASE
Format:  SET CASE { UPPER | LOWER | NONE }

Use the SET CASE (abbreviated SE CA) command on terminals which are capable of
displaying  uppercase  characters only.  SET CASE instructs EDT to flag with a
preceding  apostrophe  either  the   uppercase   characters,   the   lowercase
characters,  or  neither.   The  default  for SET CASE is NONE, which means no
characters are flagged.

You can abbreviate the keywords as follows:

    CASE    CA
    UPPER   U
    LOWER   L
    NONE    N
2 COMMAND
Format:  SET COMMAND file-specification

The SET COMMAND (abbreviated SE COM) command is used  in  a  startup  file  to
specify  the  name  of  the next startup file to read.  EDT provides a default
file type of ".EDT".  If the file is not present this  command  does  nothing;
otherwise  it  causes the current command file to be abandoned and the new one
to be read in its place.
3 STARTUP
When EDT starts up, it reads the installation-default startup file.  The  name
of  the  file  is  always  EDTSYS.   The default for the remainder of the file
specification is:  SYS:.EDT.

When opening the file, EDT combines the name and  the  default  name  together
into a complete file specification.

The installation default initialization file should have SET COMMAND EDTINI at
its  end,  so  that  the  user's  initialization  file  will be read after the
installation default initialization file.  IF EDTSYS is not  found,  EDT  will
try again using the name EDTINI and default type .EDT, so there is no need for
an installation-default initialization file that  just  contains  SET  COMMAND
EDTINI.
2 CONTROL-T
Format:  SET [NO]CONTROL-T

The SET CONTROL-T command makes CTRL/T available  to  EDT  as  a  keypad  mode
command  character  (normally  used for tab operations).  SET CONTROL-T may be
abbreviated to SE CON.  SET CONTROL-T is the default.

SET NOCONTROL-T (abbreviated SE NOC) gives CTRL/T its usual system function of
reporting  the  status  of  the  current  program (EDT).  In line mode, CTRL/T
always performs its status function.
2 CURSOR
Format:  SET CURSOR top:bottom

The SET CURSOR (abbreviated SE CU) command, used with screen editing, sets the
limits  within  which  the  cursor  is  allowed  to move without scrolling the
screen.

Top and bottom are the line numbers at the top of the screen and the bottom of
the  screen.   The  line  numbers  must  be  in  the  range of 0 to 21, with 0
specifying the top line of the screen and 21 the bottom.  The default  setting
is 7:14, allowing the cursor to move within the middle third of the screen.
2 ENTITY
Format:  SET ENTITY entity-type 'delimiter string'

Entity-type is one of the following:

    WORD        (abbreviation:  W)
    SENTENCE    (abbreviation:  S)
    PAGE        (abbreviation:  PAG)
    PARAGRAPH   (abbreviation:  PAR)

The SET ENTITY  (abbreviated  SE  E)  command  sets  the  delimiters  for  the
user-defined  change  mode  entities.  For the WORD and SENTENCE entities, the
delimiter string is a set  of  single  character  delimiters.   For  PAGE  and
PARAGRAPH,  the delimiter is a character string that delimits the entity.  See
HELP CHANGE ENTITIES for explanations of the entities.

If control characters are to be inserted into the string, they may be  in  the
form <XX> where XX must be in uppercase.  The following are recognised:  <LF>,
<VT>, <CR>, <FF>, <ESC>, and <DEL>.
2 FNF
Format:  SET [NO]FNF

The SET FNF option controls whether or not an informative message is typed out
when  you  attempt  to  edit  a non-existing file.  NOFNF opens a new file but
gives no message.
2 HELP
Format:  SET HELP [file-specification]

The SET HELP (abbreviated SE H) option lets you define which help file will be
accessed when you either give the HELP command or press the HELP KEY in keypad
mode.  The default device and directory are  always  as  listed  below  unless
overriden  by  an  explicit  device  and  directory.   SET HELP without a file
specification returns you to the original default help file.

The default file specification for the help file is HLP:EDTHELP.HLB.
2 KEYPAD
Format:  SET [NO]KEYPAD

The SET KEYPAD (abbreviated SE K) option controls whether or not  the  editing
keypad  is  to  be used when you are in CHANGE mode.  KEYPAD is set by default
for VT100 and VT52 terminals, which means the  alternate  keypad  is  used  to
enter change mode commands.
2 LINES
The SET LINES (abbreviated SE L) command controls the number of  screen  lines
used  in  either  of  the  screen versions of change mode.  Use this option to
reduce the time it takes to refresh the screen  image  when  editing  on  slow
terminals.

Format:  SET LINES n

where n is the number of lines to use.  n  must  be  between  1  and  22.   By
default, n is set to 22 lines.
2 MODE
The SET MODE (abbreviated SE M)  command  determines  which  mode  of  editing
should  be  entered after all initial processing is complete.  This command is
useful only in the startup command file.

Format:  SET MODE { LINE | CHANGE }

By default, EDT enters line mode when the startup processing is complete.  Use
SET  MODE  CHANGE  in your startup file to cause EDT to enter change mode when
startup processing is complete.
2 NUMBERS
Format:  SET [NO]NUMBERS

The SET NUMBERS (abbreviated SE  NU)  command  controls  the  typing  of  line
numbers  on  the  terminal.   Numbers  are  set on by default.  If you want to
suppress numbers, use SET NONUMBERS (abbreviated NON).
2 PARAGRAPH
Format:  SET PARAGRAPH [NO]WPS

The SET PARA command specifies a paragraph as the text between two  delimiters
and  including  any  adjacent  delimiters  (WPS),  or  the  text  between  two
delimiters (NOWPS).
2 PROMPT
Format:  SET PROMPT prompt-type "string"

Where prompt-type is either LINE, KEYPAD, NOKEYPAD, HCCHANGE, INSERT, INSERTN,
or QUERY.

The SET PROMPT command allows  redefinition  of  the  prompt  string  that  is
displayed  in  line mode, in keypad mode, in nokeypad mode, in hardcopy change
mode, in line mode when inserting, in line mode when inserting with NONUMBERS,
and with the /QUERY qualifier.

Use of this command is not recommended.  If SET PROMPT is used, note that  EDT
will  become  confused  if  the  new  string for the keypad or nokeypad prompt
causes a net motion of the cursor.

If control characters must be inserted into the string, they  may  be  in  the
form <XX> where XX must be in uppercase.  The following are recognised:  <LF>,
<VT>, <CR>, <FF>, <ESC>, and <DEL>.
2 QUIET
The SET QUIET (abbreviated SE Q) command controls whether or not the bell will
sound when an error is made in change mode.

Format:  SET [NO]QUIET

The quiet option is off (meaning the bell will sound) by default.
2 REPEAT
The SET REPEAT (abbreviated SE REP) command enables you to use  the  GOLD  key
followed  by  digits  to represent a count.  If you do not want the ability to
use counts, use SET NOREPEAT (abbreviated SE NOREP).  A warning bell sounds if
you attempt to use counts with NOREPEAT set.

Format:  SET [NO]REPEAT

By default, REPEAT is enabled.
2 SCREEN
The SET SCREEN (abbreviated SE SC) command controls the number  of  characters
displayed on a line.

Format:  SET SCREEN w

where w is the width of the screen line.  By default, the screen width is  set
to the terminal's width, as reported to EDT by the operating system.
2 SEARCH
The SET SEARCH (abbreviated SE SE) command controls several options related to
string searching.

Format: SET SEARCH  { GENERAL | EXACT | WPS |
                        CASE INSENSITIVE | CI }
                    { [UN]BOUNDED }
                    { BEGIN | END }
3 GENERAL
The GENERAL option will cause the case of letters and the presence or  absence
of diacritical marks to be ignored in search strings.  GENERAL is the default.
3 EXACT
The EXACT option will require all characters to match exactly,  including  the
case of letters and the presence of diacritical marks, in search strings.
3 WPS
The WPS option will  cause  a  case-independent  string  match  for  lowercase
letters in the search string, and a case-dependent match for uppercase letters
in the search string.
3 CI
The CI option will cause the case of letters to be ignored in search  strings,
but  not  the  presence  of diacritical marks.  CI is an abbreviation for CASE
INSENSITIVE.
3 BOUNDED
The BOUNDED (abbreviated BO) option will cause the search to be bounded  by  a
page  delimiter.   By  default,  the search is unbounded, which means that the
entire buffer will be searched.  This option has effect only in change mode.

The UNBOUNDED (abbreviated U) option causes the search not to be bounded by  a
page  delimiter, which means that the entire buffer will be searched.  This is
the default.  This option has effect only in change mode.
3 BEGIN
The BEGIN (abbreviated B) option causes the cursor to be left at the beginning
of  the search string when it is found.  This is the default.  This option has
effect only in change mode.
3 END
The END (abbreviated E) option causes the cursor to be left at the end of  the
search  string  when  it  is  found.   By  default,  the cursor is left at the
beginning.  This option has effect only in change mode.
2 SUMMARY
The SET [NO]SUMMARY command controls whether or not summary information  about
a file written with the WRITE or EXIT commands will be typed out.  The default
is SUMMARY, which means that summary information is typed.

Format:  SET [NO]SUMMARY
2 TAB
The SET TAB (abbreviated SE TA) command enables the structured tab feature and
sets the logical tab size.

Format:  SET [NO]TAB n

where n is the number of columns in a logical tab stop.

With the structured tab feature, EDT keeps a counter of the tab  level,  which
is  set  to 1 when the SET TAB command is issued.  When you use the tab key in
change mode at the beginning of a line, EDT inserts enough tabs and spaces  to
move  the  cursor  to  the  column  defined by the level n times the tab size.
Change mode subcommands can alter the tab level.  The structured  tab  feature
is disabled by default.

The tab size set by the tab command is also used by the TABS ADJUST command.
2 TERMINAL
Format: SET TERMINAL  { HARDCOPY | HCPY | VT100 | VT52 }
                      { SCROLL | NOSCROLL }
                      { EDIT | NOEDIT }

The SET TERMINAL (abbreviated SE TE) command identifies to  EDT  the  type  of
terminal  you  are  using.  Normally, EDT will set the terminal type by asking
the operating system what type it is.  If it does not appear to have  set  the
type  correctly,  you can use the SHOW TERMINAL command to see what EDT thinks
your terminal is and the SET TERMINAL command to correct it if necessary.   If
your terminal is not a VT100 or a VT52, it should be set to HCPY (hardcopy).
3 HCPY
HCPY stands for hardcopy.  EDT considers a terminal hardcopy if it  is  not  a
VT100  or  a VT52.  On such terminals change mode does not use the screen as a
window onto your buffer, but instead shows  you  the  current  line  with  the
cursor  position  indicated.  You type NOKEYPAD commands and EDT will keep you
informed by printing the current line after each command.
3 VT100
The VT100 is a family of terminals, all based on the original VT100  terminal.
This class of terminals includes the VT101, VT102, VT125, VT131 and VT132.
3 VT52
The VT52 terminal is the predecessor of the VT100 family.  It  does  not  have
reverse video, and has fewer keys in its keypad.
3 SCROLL
This option indicates that your terminal has scrolling regions and EDT may use
them.  This is the default for most VT100 terminals.
3 NOSCROLL
This option indicates that  either  your  terminal  does  not  have  scrolling
regions or EDT should not use them.  This is the default for VT52 terminals.
3 EDIT
This option indicates that your terminal has the screen  editing  features  of
the  VT102.   These  are  IL  (insert  line),  DL  (delete  line), ICM (insert
character mode) and DCH (delete characters).
3 NOEDIT
This option indicates that your terminal does  not  have  the  screen  editing
features of the VT102.
2 TEXT
Format:  SET TEXT text-type "string"

Text-type is one of the following:

    PAGE
    END

The SET TEXT command allows you to define the displayed string to  indicate  a
formfeed  character  (SET TEXT PAGE), and the displayed string to indicate the
end of the buffer (SET TEXT END).  The  string  can  not  contain  control  or
escape characters.
2 TRUNCATE
The SET TRUNCATE (abbreviated SE TR) command controls  the  handling  of  long
lines in change mode.

Format:  SET [NO]TRUNCATE

By default, truncate mode is set, which means long lines will be truncated  on
the  display  (the actual text is not altered).  If you turn off truncate mode
by using SET NOTRUNCATE, long lines will be wrapped to as many screen lines as
are necessary to display the entire line.
2 VERIFY
The SET VERIFY (abbreviated SE V) command controls  the  listing  of  commands
that are executed from the startup file or from a macro.

Format:  SET [NO]VERIFY

Verify is off by default, which means the lines are not typed.  If you turn it
on, each command line is typed as it is executed.
2 WORD
Format:  SET WORD [NO]DELIMITER

The SET WORD (abbreviated SE W) command enables you to specify that  the  word
delimiters  be  considered words by themselves (NODELIMITER), or considered as
part of the word they delimit (DELIMITER).  The default is DELIMITER.
2 WRAP
Format:  SET [NO]WRAP n

The SET WRAP (abbreviated SE W) command enables word  wrapping  and  specifies
the right margin.  Word wrapping is a feature of EDT that automatically insert
carriage returns when the text you are typing exceeds the right margin.   Word
wrapping  is  in  effect in change mode only and only if you have used the SET
WRAP command.

The SET WRAP command also sets the right  margin  for  the  change  mode  FILL
subcommmand.

SET NOWRAP (abbreviated SE NOW) disables the word wrapping feature.
1 SHOW
Format:  SHOW parameter

The SHOW (abbreviated SH) command displays selected information on the current
state of the editor.  Parameter is one of the additional topics listed below.
2 AUTOREPEAT
Format:  SHOW AUTOREPEAT

The SHOW AUTOREPEAT command displays whether EDT is allowed to manipulate  the
Autorepeat  feature  of  VT100-type  terminals or not.  See SET AUTOREPEAT for
more information.
2 BUFFER
Format:  SHOW BUFFER

The SHOW BUFFER (abbreviated SH BU)  command  lists  the  buffers  being  used
during the edit session, including the number of lines of text in each buffer.
The current buffer is marked by an equal sign (=)  before  the  name.   If  an
asterisk  follows  the  number  of  lines,  it indicates that an input file is
connected to the buffer and that there are more lines  to  be  read  from  the
file.  Thus, the line count is not accurate.
2 CASE
Format:  SHOW CASE

The SHOW CASE (abbreviated SH CA)  command  shows  the  current  case  setting
(upper, lower, or none).
2 COMMAND
Format:  SHOW COMMAND

The SHOW COMMAND (abbreviated SH COM) command  shows  the  name  of  the  last
specified  command  file.  When EDT starts to read a startup file specified by
SET COMMAND it clears this name.  For more information see HELP SET COMMAND.
2 SHOW CONTROL-T
Format:  SHOW CONTROL-T

The SHOW CONTROL-T (abbreviated SH CON) command shows the current state of the
CTRL/T  character.   If the response is "Control-t" the CTRL/T is available to
EDT as a keypad mode command character.  Otherwise, CTRL/T performs its  usual
status reporting function.
2 CURSOR
Format:  SHOW CURSOR

The SHOW CURSOR (abbreviated SH CU) command shows the current setting  of  the
cursor region.  EDT will respond with:

t:b

where t and b are integer numbers indicating the top and bottom of the  cursor
region.  See HELP SET CURSOR for an explanation of the cursor region.
2 ENTITY
Format:  SHOW ENTITY entity-type

where entity type is one of the following:

    WORD        (abbreviation:  W)
    SENTENCE    (abbreviation:  S)
    PAGE        (abbreviation:  PAG)
    PARAGRAPH   (abbreviation:  PAR)

The SHOW ENTITY (abbreviated SH EN) command  displays  the  current  delimiter
string for the specified entity.
2 FILES
Format:  SHOW FILES

The SHOW FILES (abbreviated SH FI) command displays the name of the input  and
output  files which were specified in the EDT command line.  If no output file
was specified, then the input file name is also used as the output file  name.
If /NOOUTPUT or /READONLY was specified in the command line, then this will be
indicated in place of the output file name.

If an output file was not specified in the command which initiated the editor,
then  the  output  filespec  will  be  the  same  as  the input filespec.  The
generation number will be changed during the EXIT command to the  next  higher
one.
2 FNF
Format:  SHOW FNF

The SHOW FNF command displays whether the file not found message is enabled or
disabled.
2 HELP
Format:  SHOW HELP

The SHOW HELP (abbreviated SH H) command shows the  currently  active  default
help  file  specification  and  help  file  name.  Use the SET HELP command to
redefine the help file name.
2 KEY
The SHOW KEY (abbreviated SH K) command displays the current definition  of  a
keypad or control key.

Format:  SHOW KEY key-selector

Where key-selector is one of the following:  (alternatives separated by "|")

[GOLD] number  | [GOLD] CONTROL letter   | [GOLD] CONTROL "letter"
[GOLD] CONTROL letter | GOLD character | GOLD "character" | GOLD 'character'
[GOLD] DELETE  | [GOLD] FUNCTION number

Number refers to keypad and function keys and CONTROL  letter  names  specific
control  keys (upper and lowercase letters are considered equivalent).  DELETE
refers to the delete character, which is not a control  character.   Character
refers  to  any  keyboard  key  except 0-9.  Characters !, %, ', and " must be
enclosed in quotes.

For the meaning of the string printed by the SHOW KEY command, see HELP DEFINE
KEY.
2 KEYPAD
Format:  SHOW KEYPAD

The SHOW KEYPAD (abbreviated SH KEYP) command shows the  current  setting  for

Any nonalphanumeric character except % can be used as string delimiters.

All occurrences of string-1 within  the  specified  range  are  replaced  with
string-2.   If  you  do  not specify range, a single occurrence in the current
line is substituted.  The line in which the  substitution  occurred  is  typed
after each substitution.

    Q   Quit, terminate the command.
    A   All, do the rest of the substitutions without query.
1 TAB

to  set  the  logical tab size in order for this command to work.  If you omit
range, the select range is assumed.  If a minus sign (-) precedes the count n,
the text shifts to the left.  Otherwise, it shifts to the right.
1 TYPE
The TYPE (abbreviated T) command displays the specified range of lines on  the
terminal.

Format:  TYPE [range] [/BRIEF[:n]] [/STAY]

changed  by  the  TYPE command.  This enables you to look at text elsewhere in
the buffer (or in another buffer) without losing your position.
1 WRITE
The WRITE (abbreviated WR) command creates a file from a  specified  range  of
lines.

Format:  WRITE file-spec [range]
