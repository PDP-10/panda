General command format for SORT and MERGE:
VERB/GLOBAL-SW...  IN.FIL/LOCAL-SW,...  OUT.FIL/LOCAL-SW...

Shortest command format:
S/R:n/K:n,m IN OUT

Verbs are:
EXIT            takes no arguments
HELP            takes no arguments
MERGE           see below
RUN (program) file-spec
SORT            see below
TAKE (commands from) file-spec (logging output on) file-spec

SORT and MERGE Switches are:
