           *******  SPEAR help file -- Sep. 22, 83  *******

IMPORTANT - The purpose of a HELP message is to provide understanding
and direction to the user. They must be clear, complete and unambiguous.
In order to avoid page over flow HELP messages should not exceed twenty
(72 character) lines. The top line should be blank (i.e., a <cr>.

@@MODE COMPLETION

At any prompt you can type one of the following special commands:

 /BREAK to return to the Spear prompt.
 /HELP to display this message.
 /REVERSE (or press the BACKSPACE key) to repeat an earlier prompt.
 /SHOW to display the current parameter settings.
 /GO to execute the selected function with the current parameters.

In a lengthy dialog, the /SHOW command can remind you of where you
are and what you're doing, especially if you frequently use /REVERSE.
You can sometimes avoid responding to all the prompts by typing /GO
as soon as you are satisfied with the parameter settings.

The /REVERSE command will not return to the "Next Category" prompt
in RETRIEVE and SUMMARIZE. This allows you to completely change
your selection parameters by reversing at "Time from".

To give you the opportunity to change your mind, no function will
be executed until you type "/GO" or respond to the final "confirm"
prompt.
@@INDIRECT FILES

Indirect Response Files - An Indirect Response File is an ASCII text
file that contains a list of Spear Library responses. Note:

1. Almost any editor can be used to build an Indirect Response File.

2. The responses in the file must pertain to one Spear function only.

3. The responses must be in the correct order and terminate with a /GO.

4. If /GO is omitted you will be prompted for all unsupplied responses.
   Thus, you can build a response file that prompts for specific items.

5. An Indirect Response File can be submitted at any prompt. Precede the
   file name with an @ sign. (e.g., SPEAR> @WEEKLY.COM<cr>)
@@SPEAR HELP

The SPEAR library contains functions to examine and maintain system event
files. The current full set consists of RETRIEVE, SUMMARIZE, KLERR, KLSTAT,
INSTRUCT, ANALYZE, THEORY, and COMPUTE.  Type a "?" to see which functions
you actually have. At this prompt, you can enter:

  1. a dialog by typing the function you want and pressing RETURN.
  2. your desired function and all its parameters on a single line.
  3. an indirect response file specification (preceded by "@").
  4. a special command by typing "/" (followed by the command name).

or you can type EXIT to leave Spear and return to the operating system.

At any time; ESCAPE fills in a default or completes a field, "?" shows the
current legal responses for a field, and "HELP" fully explains a field.  
HELP can also be typed after a "/" or "@" to get more information about
special commands and indirect files.
                           - for VMS users -
Unlike many VMS programs, the Spear HELP command can be typed at any
prompt to get information about the current parameter. Typing HELP at
the SPEAR prompt will always result in this message.
@@KLSTAT

KLSTAT is a switch that applies only to TOPS-20. You must have special
privileges to use it. The switch directs the operating system to capture
additional error status during CPU, Memory, and Massbus errors. At this
prompt you can:

  1. Type ON to enable the gathering of additional error information.

  2. Type OFF to disable the gathering of additional error information.

  3. Press the RETURN key or type CHECK to check the current state of
     the switch.

NOTES: Capturing the additional status is quite time-consuming and
will slow the system down considerably. Therefore, the switch should
be used only when you feel that the additional information is required
to solve a specific problem. The information captured by the KLSTAT
switch is described in the Spear Manual. (Refer to the Spear Manual
Index).

Retrieve can be used to generate reports, or it can be used to establish
and maintain device history files.  If you choose to generate a report,
you can select one of three formats: Short, Full, or Octal (Hexadecimal
on VAX/VMS systems). If you choose to generate a device history file you
will be asked if you want to merge it with an existing (history) file.

At this prompt Retrieve allows you to specify the name of the input file.
You can specify a packet file or any binary event file you want,
including one generated by Retrieve. If you specify a packet file you
will be prompted for packet numbers. Press the RETURN key to select the
default (ERROR.SYS or ERRLOG.SYS).
@@RETRIEVE PACKETS

All theories and many summaries listed in the Analyze report have a
matching packet. The packet is numbered and contains a set of pointers
that identify the records that were summarized or used as evidence to
support the theory. The packet file that was generated in conjunction
with the Analyze report contains the packets and name of the file that
was analyzed.

At this prompt Retrieve is waiting for you to specify the packets that
contain the pointers to the records that you want to select and then
translate or save. You can:

  1. Enter a single packet number.
  2. Enter a list of packet numbers separated by commas.

NOTE: If you specify multiple packets the records involved will be
arranged in the order that they appear in the event file. That is
to say, the records will not be grouped by packet number.

@@RETRIEVE CATEGORY

At this prompt you decide on how to view the event file data. You can:

  7. Type STATISTICS if you want statistic entries.
  5. Type OTHER if you want entries not included in the above categories.

NOTE: You will be prompted for time parameters later.
@@RETRIEVE SEQUENCE

Each record in the event file has an identifier called a "sequence
number" which is printed by Retrieve in the header of each entry.  If
you wnat to retrieve specific entries (which you may have seen in a
short output report), you can enter the specific sequence numbers at
this point. You can type a:

   1. single sequence number.
   2. list of sequence numbers separated by commas.
   3. range of sequence numbers separated by a dash.
   4. combination of 2 and 3.
@@RETRIEVE CODES

Generally speaking, the TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS operating systems
handle errors in a similar manner. That is, when an error occurs they
snapshot pertinent hardware and software status (at error). Then, if
applicable, an error retry algorithm is applied. Next, regardless of
whether or not the retry algorithm was successful, a second snapshot
is taken (at end). Finally, the captured status is put into a record,
assigned a code, and appended to the system event file.

The operating systems differ, however, in the way that they snapshot
the status, implement the retry algorithms, and assign codes to the
error or event record. Refer to the Spear Manual for a description of
each TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and VAX/VMS event record. The codes are listed
on the back of the Spear Reference Card.

Remember, Retrieve is used to translate and/or save selected entries in
the system event file. The result will be either an ASCII report file or
a special purpose binary file. At this prompt Retrieve is waiting for
you to specify the type of output file that you want generated. You can:

  1. Type ASCII or press the RETURN key. The result will be a report
     file. The next prompt will ask you to specify the report format.

  2. Type BINARY. The result will be a binary event file that contains
     only the events that you have specified. If you type binary, the
     the next prompt will ask you if you want to merge these entries
     with an existing binary file. The merge feature is useful if you
     are maintaining a device history file.

NOTE: If you are using the Exclude capability, you will translate or
save all of the entries that are in the input file except for those 
that you selected for exclusion during the time period you specified.
@@RETRIEVE FORMAT

At this prompt you may select the report format that you want. You can:

 1. Type SHORT. The result will be a set of brief (3 or 4 line) reports

 2. Type FULL. The result will be a set of detailed reports that list
    all of the information contained in each entry.

 3. Type OCTAL if 36-bit or HEX if 32-bit. The result will be a set of
    raw data reports that reflect the binary contents of each entry.
    This format is used for program debugging and event file verification
    purposes.

NOTE: Typically, the default format, SHORT, is used to translate packets
and lengthy system event files. The sequence number listed in the header
of each report is used to select specific entries for a Full translation.
