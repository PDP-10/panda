                          INTRODUCTION

     The Special Network is a new concept in the TOPS-20
mailsystem to satisfy a long-recognized but poorly-understood
need: to be able to compose, send, and receive mail to a "generic
network" or rather a generic set of hosts.  Many sites have
"networks" which consist of little more than a TTY link to some
other place; others have various one-of-a-kind communication
links.  It is highly impractical to implement support in the
mailsystem for every conceivable "network" of this type.

     Additionally, the technology for adding support for a
network to the mailsystem, while well-defined, is rather
complicated and its mysteries are seemingly impenetrable to even
a sophisticated system programmer who has never done it before.
A name/address translation parser must be added to the HSTNAM
module, following certain specific (and ill-documented) rules; a
network driver must be added to MMailr, and virtually the entire
mailsystem must be rebuilt to ensure that all modules utilize the
up to date version of HSTNAM.

     It was concluded that some form of generic network support
was needed which would interact with some external agent to
deliver and receive mail.

     The idea of some sort of configuration/command file was
considered and rejected.  This sort of implementation would have
the tendency to lead to a "host table"; a concept which is
completely at odds with the modern mailsystem's philosophy of
consulting external intelligent agents (a.k.a. "name servers")
for all name/address lookups.  Only in DOMAINS.TXT does any "host
table" concept (regrettably) remain.

     Additionally, there remained the problem of what to do with
the case of having multiple sites with different translation
means.  Consequently, it was decided to have a separate disk
directory for queue files to the external mail delivery agents on
a per-destination site basis.

     The advantages of this scheme become obvious when one
considers the various security implications.  Previously, a mail
delivery agent had to run privileged, even when delivering mail
to the network.  Now, it only needs access to the single
directory corresponding to the remote site it is delivering mail
to.

     To emphasize that these external agent queue files are not
MMailr format queue files, the format is similar but NOT
identical to MMailr format (see below) and is incompatible
(albeit not by much) from MMailr format.  Before writing these
files, MMailr performs any transmogrification as necessary.  Of
course, an agent going to a non-RFC 822 "network" (e.g. UUCP) may
wish to modify the headers itself to suit the needs of the remote
host.


                         SPECIFICATIONS

     A new relative domain, .#Special, is now in the mailsystem.
It identifies a "generic" network and not any particular
transport means known by the mailsystem.  In order for a site to
utilize this functionality, the system-wide logical name MAILS:
must be defined to point to the generic network root-directory.
This directory has, as its subdirectories, the names of all the
valid Special hosts known to the local site.  In addition, the
lowest level name in the directory tree for MAILS: must be set up
as the local site's "host name" on the Special network.

     To make this clear, consider the following example.  A
system called CMIRH wishes to set up a Special network which
consists of itself (always) and three other systems, named CMU,
RUTGERS, and SUMEX-AIM.  [NOTE: this is not to imply that such a
Special network exists -- I am merely describing the environment
used in debugging.]  CMIRH wishes to have the Special network
mail go to subdirectories of their MAILQ: directory, which has
the (canonical) name of PS:<MAIL.QUEUE>.  To do this, the
following line is added to CMIRH's SYSTEM:n-CONFIG.CMD:

	DEFINE MAILS: PS:<MAIL.QUEUE.CMIRH>

Subsequently, three subdirectories:

	PS:<MAIL.QUEUE.CMIRH.CMU>
	PS:<MAIL.QUEUE.CMIRH.RUTGERS>
	PS:<MAIL.QUEUE.CMIRH.SUMEX-AIM>

are created.  Similar albeit not identical actions have to be
taken at the other sites to accomplish full, two way
communications.  It is important to note that the "CMIRH"
directory at SUMEX-AIM would be PS:<MAIL.QUEUE.SUMEX-AIM.CMIRH>.

     Mail sent to a "Special" host goes to the appropriate
directory in the following format:

	<sender> <CRLF>		("user@host" format)
	<recipient-1> <CRLF>	("user" only, NOT "user@host")
	<recipient-2> <CRLF>
	 .
	 .
	 .
	<recipient-n> <CRLF>
	<FORM-FEED> <CRLF>
	... message in RFC 822 format ...

The sender and at least one recipient must be given.  Each
message is contained in its own file, all of which have a
filename of "-MAIL" and an extension which should be considered
random.

     The delivery of the messages is accomplished by an external
process which periodically checks the relevant directory, and
transmits the recipient list and text of the message in some
mutually-agreed upon format to the destination.

     Receipt of messages from a Special host is accomplished by
some mail composition agent (typically the other end of the
delivery process) which writes a standard MMailr-format queued
mail file on MAILQ: and follows the normal procedure for waking
up MMailr.  In other words, there is little or no difference
between a Special network receiver and a "standard" network
receiver such as MAISER.


                        OTHER INFORMATION

     The changes to the mailsystem to support the Special network
are in HSTNAM and MMailr.  These are now part of the standard,
officially supported version of the mailsystem.

     A sample external network driving program for a "TTY
network" is Cafard, described in CAFARD.DOC.
