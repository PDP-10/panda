ABSTRACT:

     MM is an electronic mailsystem that runs on the DECSYSTEM-20,
similar in a number of ways to Digital's DECmail/MS-20, which was
derived from an earlier version of MM.

     The MM mailsystem consists of a number of components, and is
completely self-contained.  MM's components include:

	- MM is the program that users run to compose and queue
	  messages for delivery.  It also provides for reading
	  incoming messages and maintenance of a database of
	  those messages.

	- Send allows TOPS-20 users to have the functionality of
	  TOPS-10's "SEND" command, with several enhancements
	  including multi-line sends, redisplay of prior sends,
	  and reply to most recent send.

	- MMailr delivers queued messages to their intended
	  recipients, including network mail and sends.

	- SndSrv delivers local sends.
	
	- MMailbox performs mailbox lookup and allows the system
	  manager a great deal of flexibility in defining
	  mailboxes (see below).

	- Cafard provides a means of delivering mail via TTY
	  lines and/or dial-out modems.

	- Maiser and DMaser receive incoming messages from the
	  ARPA Internet and DECnet.

	- Also included are several minor components to assist in
	  mailsystem performance monitoring and debugging.

     A unique and powerful feature of the MM mailsystem is the
capability for the system manager to define mailboxes above and beyond
the level of user names.  In the MM mailsystem, a mailbox is
implicitly assigned to a user's MAIL.TXT, but can also be an auxillary
file or an indirect file.  In addition, by entry of a text line in a
system file (MAIL:MAILING-LISTS.TXT) the system manager can define
mailbox aliases, mail forwardings, and mailing lists.

     For example, the following entries in MAILING-LISTS.TXT:

	BILL= JONES
	SMITH= BOBSMITH@SYSTEM-B
	SECRETARIES= SALLY ANN LISA JOE
	RESEARCH= @PS:<RS-VP>RES.DIS
	REMARKS= *PS:<OPERATOR>REMARKS.TXT

declare BILL as an alias for JONES; SMITH's mail should be forwarded
to BOBSMITH at another computer (SYSTEM-B); SECRETARIES as a mailing
list with members SALLY, ANN, LISA, and JOE; RESEARCH going to the
list of mailboxes found in PS:<RS-VP>RES.DIS, and mail to REMARKS
being appended to the file PS:<OPERATOR>REMARKS.TXT.

     Sites running a cooperating "Finger" system will find that
they also have the capability of mailing to an individual by
personal name, e.g. "Bill Jones" could be used as an alternative
mailbox for JONES.  The Stanford Finger system is included as
part of the MM distribution, although it is not required for the
operation of the mailsystem if mailing by personal names is not
necessary.

     MM has the capability to have multiple specifications for
message retrieval, to quickly isolate the message the user wishes
to retrieve.  This is especially useful for users who wish to
keep hundreds of back messages online (the user can, of course,
delete and permanently erase old messages at any time at the
user's option).  For example, suppose a corporate officer wishes
to locate a message sent sometime in May or June 1983 from user
JONES regarding the Paris subsidiary.  Quite some time could be
spent wading through hundreds of old messages.  Or, the officer
could invoke MM and give the command:

 READ SINCE 1-MAY-83 BEFORE 30-JUN-83 FROM "JONES" TEXT "Paris subsidiary"

     As distributed, MMailr supports local delivery and network
delivery to the ARPA Internet, DECnet, Chaosnet, and Pup
Ethernet.  It also supports mail relaying between these networks.
The network support has been implemented in a modular fashion so
it is quite feasible for a site to add support for its own
special network configuration.

     Some version or other of MM is in use on a large number of
TOPS-20 sites.  Stanford University is a good example; at
Stanford MM supports a user community of several thousand users
on 11 DECSYSTEM-20's connected via Pup Ethernet and ARPA
Internet.  Because of the operating system-independent protocols
nature of the protocols used with Pup Ethernet and Internet,
messages composed by the MM mailsystem can be delivered to (and
received by) other operating systems.  Stanford's environment
includes a large number of VAX systems running both VMS and Unix;
electronic mail between the VAX and DECSYSTEM-20 systems is fully
supported and hundreds of pieces of electronic mail are
transacted daily between these various systems.

     MM's DECnet support uses the ARPA Internet "SMTP" protocol.
