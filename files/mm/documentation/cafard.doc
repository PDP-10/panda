                          INTRODUCTION

     Cafard (French for "cockroach") is a program for
interchanging mail over TTY lines.  It is designed to be used
with the Special network interface in the TOPS-20 mailsystem (see
SPECIAL-NETWORK.DOC for information on the Special interface).
Cafard is distributed by PANDA PROGRAMMING as part of the TOPS-20
MM mailsystem package.

     Cafard requires no special privileges other than read/write
access to the queue directory it must dequeue from, write access
to MAILQ: (e.g. what all other users on the system have), and
access to whatever TTY line(s) it must use.

     Unlike MMailr, Cafard is not a continually-running system
daemon, nor does it operate automatically.  It is instead
intended to be run as a periodically-resubmitted batch job.  This
is because many applications (e.g. anything which incurs line
charges, such as phone lines or X.25) of TTY mail should only be
run at certain hours.


                         SPECIFICATIONS

     Cafard is in one of two modes: Cafard user and Cafard
server.  The differences between the two are as follows:
 . a Cafard server is invoked by GET CAFARD then REENTER; a
   Cafard user by RUN CAFARD.
 . a Cafard server does its I/O on its own TTY:, while a Cafard
   user does I/O on a separate TTY opened as a device.
 . A Cafard user processes two "dialog script" files which
   instruct Cafard what to send over the line to get in contact
   with a Cafard server, and how to clean up afterwards.
 . A Cafard user first delivers mail to the server host then
   picks up mail for it; a Cafard server does the reverse.

     The user Cafard process should be connected to the
appropriate MAILS: subdirectory for the host it is expected to
connect to.  In addition to any -MAIL.* files which may be on
that directory, there should also be two "dialog script" files
named OPEN-DIALOG.TXT and CLOSE-DIALOG.TXT.  A dialog script file
is actually a small programming language designed for interacting
with terminals, PADs, modems, etc.  It uses the following
grammar:

open_dialog	:= line_list CRLF command_list
close_dialog	:= command_list

command_list	:= command [command_list]
command		:= [WS] [comment | eat_command | loop_command |
		    lose_command | message_command | send_command |
		    test_command | wait_command]
line_list	:= octal_number [`,' octal_number]
loop_command_list
		:= command | exit_command | repeat_command
		   [loop_command_list]

comment		:= `!' string `!'
eat_command	:= `E'
exit_command	:= `X'
loop_command	:= `<' loop_command_list `>'
lose_command	:= `L'
message_command	:= `[' string `]'
repeat_command	:= `^'
send_command	:= `"' string `"'
test_command	:= `=' [time] `"' string `"'
		   [+ command_list]
		   [- command_list]
		   [~]
wait_command	:= `W'

CRLF		:= CR LF
WS		:= NUL TAB LF FF CR SPACE

     So much for the grammar.  What this all means is that a
dialog script file consists of a set of commands with optional
whitespace between them.  The OPEN-DIALOG.TXT file starts off
with a list of TTY lines which Cafard should try to use followed
by a CRLF, then dialog commands.  The CLOSE-DIALOG.TXT file has
only dialog commands.

     The `!' character opens a comment, which is terminated by a
second `!'.  Note that comments are NOT terminated by CRLF or by
the termination of a loop or conditional.  This can lead to a
number of pitfalls; a single missing `!' can cause truly amazing
results.

     The `[' character begins a string to be output to the
console terminal (as opposed to the TTY line the protocol is
happening on).  It is useful in logs for progress and error
reporting.  It is closed by a `]'.  The same cautions noted for
comments apply here.

     The `"' command begins a string to be sent to the TTY line.
Such things as network connect commands, login commands, etc.
would be sent by this.  It is closed by another `"' and at the
risk of being tiresome I'll remind you to read the cautions about
comments and log strings as they are applicable here to.

     The `L' command indicates that the dialog has encountered
some error.  Typically, this is as a result of a test command
(see below) returning failure (or perhaps truth).  The dialog
file is aborted and Cafard gives up on that line for the nonce.
It will retry on another line, or on this line again after the
delay period (see the sources for more information about the
delay period; it is an assembly switch).

     The `<' command begins a loop.  The comments following up to
a `>' (NOT part of a comment or other string!!) are considered
part of the loop.  Within a loop, a few additional commands are
valid.  `X' gets out of the loop, searching for the `>' and
resuming execution of the script at that point.  `^' goes back to
the top of the loop, up to the Cafard-defined maximum number of
iterations (see the sources), at which point `^' becomes a no-op.
This iteration maximum feature is an alternative way to tests to
time out waiting for some particular thing to happen.

     The `=' command begins a test.  It is optionally followed by
a number, which is the maximum number of seconds to block in the
test before timing out.  Immediately following (no whitespace!)
is a quoted (with `"') string.  Cafard will read from the TTY
line and try to find a string matching the test string.  If it
sucessfully reads the string, Cafard will search for either a `+'
or a `~' (once more with feeling, read the cautions about
strings) and resume execution at that point.  Otherwise, if
Cafard's timeout count expires, it will search for either a `-'
or a `~'.  It is good practice to always include a `~', and is
required if only one clause (`+' or `-') is given.  If both
clauses are given, note that the first one will fall into the
second one unless it is in a loop.  Loops can be used as control
structures by virtue of the `X' command.

     `E' and `W' are used for synchronization.  The `E' command
will read all TTY input available now and in the next 3 seconds.
This is useful to "eat" some arbitrary unknown large chunk of
input.  The `W' command will block for 250 ms; this is useful for
slowing down characters sent to the line.  For example, a Ven-Tel
modem expects human typing rates when talking to its dialer and
will discard input which is coming in "too fast".


                        OTHER INFORMATION

     Cafard's high level protocol for sending messages is simply
a byte-stream of the Special network format queue file to the
remote host followed by an EOF signal.  This is done by the $PBIN,
$PSOUT, and $PEOF routines.  An EOF occuring at the start of the
message indicates that no more messages are forthcoming.  The low
level protocol takes care of flow and error correction as well as
providing the out-of-band EOF signal.

     The current protocol implemented is Cafard Phase I, which is
described in CAFPRO.MAC.  This is a lock-step protocol which
makes extremely conservative decisions in order to talk to
systems with inadequate power to handle high-speed TTY bursts for
a long period of time.  While Phase I should work on any TTY or
modem connection, its performance may be suboptimal and it may
not deliver satisfactory results on TTY connections going into an
X.25 etc. network.

     Phase II is (as of this writing a future) upwards extension
of Phase I.  It supports windowing and larger data packets than
Phase I as well as negotiated window and data packet sizes.
Cafard links talk in Phase I protocol unless a negotiated
agreement occures to use Phase II.

     Phase III is an upwards-compatible extension of Phase II to
support bidirectional mail transmission; that is, mail is
transmitted simultaneously in both directions and the
acknowledgements are piggy-backed on the data packets.

     It is possible that the milestones established by Phase II
and Phase III may be reversed in the actual implementation.

     Besides the TOPS-20 implementation described here, a server-
only implementation of Cafard exists for the WAITS operating
system.
