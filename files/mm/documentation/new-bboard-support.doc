     Assembling with BBoard support:

NEWBBF=1 for new BBoard support

     New commands available: (with help facility installed, of
course)

BBOARD file-spec	;File-spec defaults to PS:<BBOARD>MAIL.TXT
SET BBOARD-FILES file-list  ;Define a list of 'interesting' BBoards
SET BEHAVIOR-ON-RESCAN		;See the HELP SET ... stuff
SET VERBOSE-BBOARD-MESSAGES	;	"	"
FIND FIRST		;Find BBoard with new mail
FIND NEXT, or STEP	;Find next BBoard in list with new mail
IGNORE			;Set last-read in current BBoard to now and FIND NEXT
BBDATE date-spec	;Set the last-read date of current BBoard

     Several new date-time formats have been added for general use:
 . Keywords FIRST and LAST refer to receive date/time of first and
   last messages
 . * and % are synonyms for LAST
 . # n refers to the receive date of message n
 . - n refers to n days in the past

     If not explicitly specified, fields in BBOARD file specs
default to PS:<BBOARD>MAIL.TXT, so, for example, BBOARD AP looks
for the file PS:<BBOARD>AP.TXT, but BBOARD <FORUM> looks for
PS:<FORUM>MAIL.TXT.

     COPY and MOVE command in BBoard read mode now default to
<user>MAIL.TXT (or <alias>MAIL.TXT).

     For system maintainers:
At MIT-XX I set up a new BBOARD as follows:

(1) COPY NUL: (TO) <BBOARD>foo.TXT;P777746,
    BYTE 7
(2) Set this file 'permanent' with REV or some other utility
(3) COPY NUL: (TO) <BBOARD>foo.IDX;P777760
(4) Put an entry BBFOO= *<BBOARD>FOO.TXT
(5) Request from the moderator that mail be sent to BBFOO@MIT-XX

I also run a batch job in the evenings that deletes old messages:

	@NOERROR
	@ENABLE
	@CONNECT BBOARD:
	@BB GET AP.TXT
	*DELETE BEFORE -21
	*EXPUNGE

	*GET ARMS-D.TXT
	*DELETE BEFORE -21
	*EXPUNGE
			;etc...
	*BB AP.TXT		!Update all indexes last so read/write dates
	*BB ARMS-D.TXT		!don't get screwed up
			;etc...
	*EXIT
	@SUBMIT BBOARD:BB.CTL/OUTPUT:NOLOG/UNIQUE:NO/BATCH:SUPERCEDE/TIME:0:30:0/AFTER:TODAY
