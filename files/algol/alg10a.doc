ALG10A.DOC -- Version 10A(145)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY.

This is a maintainance  release  of  DECsystem-10  Algol  intended  to
include all bug-fixes made since version 10(741), both those published
in the Software Dispatch and those  reported  to  us  through  non-SPR
channels.

In addition individual users have made suggestions for enhancements to
ALGDDT  which we have implemented for this release.  This results in a
small change in funtionality although not sufficient to  merit  a  new
version   number.   These  improvements  include  an  enhanced  UNWIND
command, a RETRY command, additions to the PAUSE command and  improved
control  C handling.  Most of these are documented in the programmer's
guide, which was prepared with this release in mind.

The changes made for  this  version  will  not  effect  the  operating
environment requirements given for version 10(741).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES.

The following changes will be noticed by the user in 10A(145):

     1.  The  documentation  lists  the   three   library   procedures
         RAND,ONTRACE  &  OFFTRACE, this is a documentation error, the
         procedures being correctly  called  RAN,TRACEON  &  TRACEOFF.
         However since users have not complained about this before and
         have presumably adapted to the error, both spellings will now
         have  the  correct  effect  (rendering  all  current programs
         compatable).

     2.  If an identifier is undeclared or misused, its spelling  will
         now  be  included in the error message.  It is felt this will
         be particularly useful when a listing is not being  generated
         and only the error meassages appear on the terminal.

     3.  The library procedures READ and INLINE will now recognise  an
         EOF  as  an  LF, and treat it as a terminator to input in any
         circumstance where a LF would do so (before, encountering  an
         EOF would result in a run-time error).

     4.  The library procedure READ now no longer throws away the byte
         immediately following a quoted string.

     5.  The ALGDDT command RETRY as documented  in  the  programmer's
         guide is now implemented.

     6.  The ALGDDT command PAUSE is now fully implemented, as per the
         programmer's guide.

     7.  Enhanced ALGDDT command UNWIND.

         the UNWIND command has been  extended  to  know  about  block
         levels  within  procedures  as  well  as the procedure levels
         themselves.  The new command format is  as  follows:   UNWIND
         Same as BACK - return to original context

         UNWIND n       Change to dynamic procedure level <n>
         UNWIND n.m     Change to dynamic proc.  level <n>  and  block
                        level <m>
         UNWIND -n      Change by <n> procedure levels.
         UNWIND -.m     Change by <m> block levels.
         UNWIND 0       Change to outermost block

         The WHERE command has  also  been  extended  to  include  the
         additional information required by this extension.

     8.  The OTS no longer enables for trapping UUO or QUOTA exhausted
         errors,  and  the  monitor  should  produce error messages if
         either occur.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES.

     1.  The library procedures OPENFILE,INPUT & OUTPUT will not  work
         correctly  if passed a dynamic string as an actual parameter;
         that is a string procedure or  a  string  that  is  itself  a
         formal.  Doing so results in a runtime error.

     2.  Interrupting a program that is performing a monitor call with
         a  control  C  can sometimes result in an immediate return to
         monitor level instead of invoking ALGDDT.  In this  case  the
         user  should  type  CONTINUE  which  will enter ALGDDT in the
         correct manner.

     3.  Edit 776 published as an answer to SPR #10797 claimed to  fix
         a  problem  of bad code generation using embedded assignments
         to long real arrays.  We have since found that  this  is  not
         the  case  and  have  not included this edit in this release.
         Until we can fix this problem  properly  we  recommend  users
         avoid using embedded assignments to long real arrays.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.

The batch command file ALGOL.CTL contains all  the  details  necessary
for  building  ALGOL  version  10A.   The files ALGOL.SHR, ALG145.SHR,
ALGLIB.REL and ALGDDT.HLP should be put on SYS:.   It  is  recommended
that installations using .EXE files should convert them before use.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES.

There now follows the list of edits included in version  10A.   Please
note  that  with  edit  #777 ALGOL used up the supply of 3 digit octal
edit numbers allocated to it.  All subsequent edits will  be  numbered
as  if  old edit #635 = #001 so as to bring the edit numbers into line
with those for DECsystem-20 ALGOL.  Therefore all edits after 635 have
been  renumbered in the sources for 10A, and all references to earlier
edit numbers removed.  Four digit edit numbers are fixes  to  problems
or enhancements not originating from an SPR.
