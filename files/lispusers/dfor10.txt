There is a package on <LISPUSERS> called DFOR10. It contains definitions
of OPENSTREAM, GETSTREAM, BIN and BOUT which work in Interlisp-10. In
addition, there are functions \BIN and \BOUT which, at least in Interlisp-10,
assume that you give them "streams." This isn't a full-fledged stream interface
for Interlisp-10, e.g., you can't pass the streams to READ and PRINT because
they're really just JFNs. 

With a little bit of trouble, it is possible to write efficient code which
runs both in Interlisp-10 and in Interlisp-D.
