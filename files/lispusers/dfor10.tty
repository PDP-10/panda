The file [maxc]<LISPUSERS>DFOR10 & .COM contain dummy versions of
	OPENSTREAM
	BIN
	BOUT
	GETSTREAM
which will work with (many) restrictions in Interlisp-10. In this
implementaiton, a "stream" is in fact a JFN; many file functions 
will NOT work when handed one (e.g., READ/PRINT). 
However, this is sufficient for many applications who want to
write transportable code.
