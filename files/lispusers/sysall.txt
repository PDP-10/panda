<LISP>SYSALL.TXT

sysall[subtree] is a maintenance utility designed to scan through the entire
file system, identifying Interlisp MAKESYSes and SYSOUTS on them.  It
leaves its output (sorted by date of the makesys) in a file on the
user's directory called SYSOUT.OWNERS.

The sole argument can be anything that can be passed to DIRECTORY as its
first argument, i.e. NIL will process the user's directory; '<MYCIN> will
scan the <MYCIN> directory; '<MYCIN*> will scan <MYCIN> and its
subdirectories; and '<*> will scan the entire file system.

Scanning the entire file system is quite expensive, so this is best run
only when the machine is largely unused.  Files that cannot be opened by
SYSOUTP will be entered in SYSOUT.OWNERS and so noted.
