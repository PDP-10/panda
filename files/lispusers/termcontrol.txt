Subject: Interlisp-10 TERMCONTROL.COM package
To: System

When loaded, <LISPUSERS>TERMCONTROL.COM defines 3 functions; DISPLAYTERMP,
TerminalType, and TerminalSetup.  (TerminalType newtype) sets the terminal
type to be newtype, or returns the current terminal type if newtype is not
given.  (DISPLAYTERMP) returns T if the terminal is a display terminal; NIL
otherwise.  (TerminalSetup (TerminalType)) will customize ECHOCONTROL and
DELETECONTROL to the user's TerminalType.  In many cases, this eliminates
the annoying echoing of deleted characters; backspacing over them instead.
Currently few terminal types are accomodated.  If yours isn't, drop me a note.
