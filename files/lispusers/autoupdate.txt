	Autoupdate is a tool designed to maintain the <LISPUSERS>
directory at a site.  It is used in two phases:
1) Someone at a source site or directory (ideally <LISPUSERS> at PARC) runs
Autoupdate and makes a
"roster" file--a file which lists the FILEDATES of each lisp file and the
length of each non-lisp file in the source directory (typically lispusers or
<xeos>).  The file is then FTP'd to the remote site, where:
2) Autoupdate is again run.  This time it reads the "roster" file and compares
the FILEDATES with those at the local site.  Where there is a new version
available, a
MIC file is generated, which when handed to DO.EXE will automatically FTP
only those packages of which there are new versions.  Completely new packages
will be queried about.
	In fact I usually FTP all of LISPUSERS or XEOS and do both phases
locally since I don't have a login at PARC.  I do use the intended mode
for updating TINY for consistency with SUMEX-AIM.  Since I partition the
<xeos> stuff into several directories I do phase two several times.

Notes:
	This doucmentation file is present mostly to test Autoupdate itself, and
doesn't quite document the system at this time.
	Bugs: I should have an option which only retrieves COM files or DCOM
files.  I should put destination filenames on separate lines to work with
PUPFTP (as an option).  I should use ASKUSER more.  I should generate an
appropriate header on the MIC file.  I should abstract the "rules" which
decide what to do with a package more fully.  I should explain the options in
this file.
