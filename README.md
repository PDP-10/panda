# Panda TOPS-20 distribution

The Panda version of TOPS-20 includes a vast set of extensions and bugfixes, some of which originated at Stanford in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as a substantial library of non-DEC software available nowhere else. ![Panda](panda.gif)

The Panda distribution is the creation of [Mark Crispin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Crispin) (MRC). May he rest in peace.

The code in this repository was extracted from [the 16-Jun-2006 snapshot](http://panda.trailing-edge.com/) of the Panda distribution of TOPS-20.
